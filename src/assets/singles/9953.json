They can be low-grade (grade II) or high-grade (grade III, also called anaplastic). While they can be found anywhere within the cerebral hemisphere, they are most common in the frontal and temporal lobes. They are generally soft, grayish-pink tumors that often contain mineral deposits (calcifications), areas of hemorrhage, and/or cysts. They tend to grow slowly and may be present for many years before they are diagnosed. Common symptoms include seizures, headaches and changes in personality. Other symptoms vary by the size and location of the tumor.[11995] The exact cause of opigodendrogliomas is unknown. Some appear to have a chromosome abnormality involving loss of chromosomes 1p and 19q.[11995][11996] Treatment generally involves surgical removal of the tumor followed by <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001918.htm\" target=\"_blank\">radiation therapy</a> and/or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002324.htm\" target=\"_blank\">chemotherapy</a>. Recurrent tumors may need additional surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.[11995]","dateModified":"2016-08-08T07:43:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":11014,"questionText":"Are oligodendrogliomas rare?","answerText":"In the United States, a rare disease is defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people. This definition was created by Congress in the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/lawsenforcedbyfda/significantamendmentstothefdcact/orphandrugact/default.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Orphan Drug Act of 1983</a>. Other countries have their own official definitions of a rare disease. In Europe, a disease is defined as rare when it affects fewer than 1 in 2,000 people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to <a href=\"http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=en&amp;Expert=46484\" target=\"_blank\">Orphanet</a>, the annual incidence can be estimated at around one new case per 100,000 individuals per year. The prevalence is estimated at 1/300,000, but this may be an underestimate, as the condition is likely under-diagnosed.[11996]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.cbtrus.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States</a> (CBTRUS) was formed in 1992 through the American Brain Tumor Association as a resource for epidemiologic data on primary brain tumors.

According to CBTRUS, the incidence of oligodendrogliomas, including anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, is approximately 0.3 per 100,000 persons.[12133] Depending on the study, these tumors account for 4% to 15% of intracranial gliomas.[11995][12133] Based on this data, it appears that these are rare tumors.","dateModified":"2016-08-31T21:40:00","resourceClassificationName":"Statistics","references":[{"referenceId":11995,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Oligodendroglioma","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"American Brain Tumor Association","date":"2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.abta.org/brain-tumor-information/types-of-tumors/oligodendroglioma.html","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11996,"authors":"Grill J","articleTitle":"Oligodendroglial tumor","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet","date":"2007","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=en&Expert=46484","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12133,"authors":"Stevens GHJ","articleTitle":"Brain Tumors: Meningiomas and Gliomas","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Cleveland Clinic","date":"2010","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/medicalpubs/diseasemanagement/hematology-oncology/brain-tumors/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":9472,"relatedDiseaseName":"Anaplastic oligodendroglioma","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
