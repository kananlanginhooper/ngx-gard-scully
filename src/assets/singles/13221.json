Other symptoms may include motor and language development delay, regression of learning abilities, autistic-like behavior, characteristic hand movements, and behavioral problems. Physical features may include abnormal head shape (plagiocephaly), very small head (microcephaly), reduced muscle tone (hypotonia), and crossed eyes (strabismus). This condition is caused by mutations in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IQSEC2\" target=\"_blank\">IQSEC2</a> gene, which is located on <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/X\" target=\"_blank\">chromosome X</a>.[13635][13636][13637] Depending on the severity of the gene mutation, the features can range from only intellectual disability to a syndrome that includes the other symptoms. In general, males are more affected than females.[13635] Most cases are not inherited from a parent but are caused by a new (de novo) mutation. When the condition is inherited, the pattern is called X-linked recessive. There is no specific treatment, but early intervention and other services can support development. Seizure medications such as lamotrigine and rufinamide have been reported to control seizures in some people.[13638]","dateModified":"2017-07-25T10:45:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":13635,"authors":"Alexander-Bloch AF, McDougle CJ, Ullman Z  & Sweetser DA","articleTitle":"IQSEC2 and X-linked syndromal intellectual disability","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Psychiatr Genet","date":"June 2016","volume":"26(3)","pages":"101-108","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27010919","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13636,"authors":"Gandomi SK, Farwell Gonzalez KD, Parra M et al","articleTitle":"Diagnostic exome sequencing identifies two novel IQSEC2 mutations associated with X-linked intellectual disability with seizures: implications for genetic counseling and clinical diagnosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Genet Couns","date":"June 2014","volume":"23(3)","pages":"289-298","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24306141","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13638,"authors":"Zerem A, Haginoya K, Lev, D. et al","articleTitle":"The molecular and phenotypic spectrum of IQSEC2-related epilepsy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Epilepsia","date":"2016","volume":"57","pages":"1858-1869","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27665735","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
