The most common type of SCID is called X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). Another form of SCID is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA).[7430] Infections are treated with specific antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral agents and administration of intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin.[8059] The most effective treatment is transplantation of blood-forming stem cells from the bone marrow of a healthy person.[7430]","dateModified":"2017-06-28T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":7529,"questionText":"How is severe combined immunodeficiency inherited?","answerText":"SCID can be inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.genetics.edu.au/Publications-and-Resources/Genetics-Fact-Sheets/Fact%20Sheet%2010\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked recessive</a> or <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> manner depending on the genetic cause of the condition. <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/5618/x-linked-severe-combined-immunodeficiency/Resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked SCID</a> is the most common type of SCID and is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA genetic disorder is X-linked if the disease-causing gene  is on the <a href=\"http://www.ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/X\" target=\"_blank\">X chromosome</a>.

In females, having one copy of the disease-causing gene would make them a carrier without the genetic disorder; a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. This is why X-linked recessive disorders, including X-linked SCID, occur much more frequently in males. Because fathers only pass their Y chromosome on to their sons, fathers cannot pass X-linked disorders on to their sons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe other, less common causes of SCID are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. These types are due to mutations in disease-causing genes on other chromosomes (not the sex chromosomes). In autosomal recessive genetic disorders, a person must have mutations in both copies of the disease-causing gene in order to have signs or symptoms of the disorder. In most cases, the affected person inherits one disease-causing copy of the gene from each of the parents, who are typically carriers with no signs and symptoms of the genetic disorder.","dateModified":"2017-06-28T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[]},{"questionId":5060,"questionText":"How is severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) diagnosed?","answerText":"A diagnosis of SCID may be suspected if a&nbsp;baby shows any of the following persistent symptoms within the first year of life:[4068]\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Eight or more ear infections </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Two or more cases of pneumonia </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Infections that do not resolve with antibiotic treatment for two or more months</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Failure to gain weight or grow normally </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Infections that require intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatment </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Deep-seated infections, such as pneumonia that affects an entire lung or an abscess in the liver </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Persistent thrush in the mouth or throat </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    A family history of immune deficiency or infant deaths due to infections </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A diagnosis can be confirmed by blood tests. Blood tests show significantly lower-than-normal levels of T cells and antibodies.[4068]&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince there are other conditions that can result in lower-than-normal numbers of the different types of lymphocytes, the most important tests are those of T-cell function by placing blood lymphocytes in culture tubes, and treating them with various stimulants. Normal T-lymphocytes react to these stimulants by undergoing cell division. In contrast, lymphocytes from patients with SCID usually do not react to these stimuli.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nImmunoglobulin levels are usually very low in SCID. Most commonly (but not always), all immunoglobulin classes are depressed (IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe diagnosis of SCID can also be made before the baby is born if there has been another infant in the family with the disorder and if the gene defect has been identified. If genetic analysis had been completed on the infant in the family with SCID, a diagnosis can be determined during subsequent pregnancies. This can be done by molecular testing of cells from a chorionic villous sampling (CVS) or from an amniocentesis, where a small amount of amniotic fluid (which contains fetal cells) is removed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEarly diagnosis, before the infant has had a chance to develop any infections, is very valuable since bone marrow transplants given in the first three months of life have a 94% success rate. In fact, screening newborns to detect SCID soon after birth has been made possible because of recent scientific advances. Approximately half of the babies born in the U.S. are now being screened for SCID.</p>","dateModified":"2017-06-28T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Diagnosis","references":[{"referenceId":4068,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Learning about severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Human Genome Research Institute","date":"July 2010","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.genome.gov/13014325","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13528,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Severe Combined Immune Deficiency and Combined Immune Deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Immune Deficiency Foundation","date":"2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://primaryimmune.org/about-primary-immunodeficiencies/specific-disease-types/severe-combined-immune-deficiency-and-combined-immune-deficiency/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":5748,"relatedDiseaseName":"Adenosine deaminase deficiency","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12653,"relatedDiseaseName":"DOCK2 Deficiency","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":9987,"relatedDiseaseName":"Severe combined immunodeficiency with sensitivity to ionizing radiation","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":9986,"relatedDiseaseName":"Severe combined immunodeficiency, atypical","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":5618,"relatedDiseaseName":"X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[{"caseId":45808,"abbreviatedInquiry":"In the case of X-linked SCID, if a girl has SCID it means she inherited a defective X gene from both parents.

All males who inherit the mutation will be affected, and all females who inherit the mutation will be carriers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause it is not possible for a male to be an unaffected carrier of X-linked SCID, parents cannot both be carriers of this type.","dateModified":"2014-05-27T11:51:00","references":[]},{"questionId":2567,"questionText":"How can I find a genetics professional in my area?","answerText":"To find a medical professional who specializes in genetics, you can ask your doctor for a referral or you can search for one yourself.

The most common type of SCID is called X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). Another form of SCID is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA).[7430] Infections are treated with specific antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral agents and administration of intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin.[8059] The most effective treatment is transplantation of blood-forming stem cells from the bone marrow of a healthy person.[7430]","dateModified":"2017-06-28T00:00:00","references":[{"referenceId":7430,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Learning About Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"NHGRI","date":"2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.genome.gov/13014325","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8059,"authors":"Hershfield M","articleTitle":"Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"Mar 2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1483","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":5060,"questionText":"How is severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) diagnosed?","answerText":"A diagnosis of SCID may be suspected if a&nbsp;baby shows any of the following persistent symptoms within the first year of life:[4068]\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Eight or more ear infections </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Two or more cases of pneumonia </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Infections that do not resolve with antibiotic treatment for two or more months</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Failure to gain weight or grow normally </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Infections that require intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatment </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Deep-seated infections, such as pneumonia that affects an entire lung or an abscess in the liver </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    Persistent thrush in the mouth or throat </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    A family history of immune deficiency or infant deaths due to infections </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A diagnosis can be confirmed by blood tests. Blood tests show significantly lower-than-normal levels of T cells and antibodies.[4068]&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince there are other conditions that can result in lower-than-normal numbers of the different types of lymphocytes, the most important tests are those of T-cell function by placing blood lymphocytes in culture tubes, and treating them with various stimulants. Normal T-lymphocytes react to these stimulants by undergoing cell division. In contrast, lymphocytes from patients with SCID usually do not react to these stimuli.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nImmunoglobulin levels are usually very low in SCID. Most commonly (but not always), all immunoglobulin classes are depressed (IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe diagnosis of SCID can also be made before the baby is born if there has been another infant in the family with the disorder and if the gene defect has been identified. If genetic analysis had been completed on the infant in the family with SCID, a diagnosis can be determined during subsequent pregnancies. This can be done by molecular testing of cells from a chorionic villous sampling (CVS) or from an amniocentesis, where a small amount of amniotic fluid (which contains fetal cells) is removed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEarly diagnosis, before the infant has had a chance to develop any infections, is very valuable since bone marrow transplants given in the first three months of life have a 94% success rate. In fact, screening newborns to detect SCID soon after birth has been made possible because of recent scientific advances. Approximately half of the babies born in the U.S. are now being screened for SCID.</p>","dateModified":"2017-06-28T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Diagnosis","references":[{"referenceId":4068,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Learning about severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Human Genome Research Institute","date":"July 2010","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.genome.gov/13014325","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13528,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Severe Combined Immune Deficiency and Combined Immune Deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Immune Deficiency Foundation","date":"2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://primaryimmune.org/about-primary-immunodeficiencies/specific-disease-types/severe-combined-immune-deficiency-and-combined-immune-deficiency/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}]}],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
