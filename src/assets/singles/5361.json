The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with chromosome 8p duplication include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the duplication on to their children. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.[10134]","dateModified":"2015-12-02T20:13:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[{"caseId":45144,"abbreviatedInquiry":"Can a chromosome 8p duplication be corrected?

This is because when a person is born with a chromosome abnormality, that deletion or duplication is in every one (or a large portion) of the billions of cells that make up his/her body. Scientists have not yet developed a method for adding back the deleted portion of a chromosome or taking away a duplicated segment of a chromosome. However, symptoms caused by a chromosome disorder can be treated as they arise.
