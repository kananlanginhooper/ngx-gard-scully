EB is a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. Erosions and blisters form in response to minor injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching.[2310] In EB simplex with mottled pigmentation, blistering may begin at birth.[4288] People with this condition have a mottled appearance of their skin (ie., darker and lighter colored spots of skin).[4288] Their skin may seem to age more quickly and bruise easily.[4288]&nbsp;EB simplex with mottled pigmentation is caused by a mutation in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/KRT5\" target=_blank>keratin-5 gene</a> (KRT5) and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=_blank>autosomal dominant</a> fashion.[4288] ","dateModified":"2011-09-07T16:06:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":6359,"relatedDiseaseName":"Epidermolysis bullosa","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":10752,"relatedDiseaseName":"Epidermolysis bullosa simplex","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[{"caseId":29131,"abbreviatedInquiry":"My 1.5 year old&nbsp;daughter has epidermolysis bullosa simplex with mottled pigmentation.

Treatment&nbsp;of EBS typically involves&nbsp;supportive care to protect the skin from blistering, and the&nbsp;use of dressings that will not further damage the skin and will promote healing. Prevention of blisters may involve applying&nbsp;aluminum chloride to palms and soles to reduce blister formation; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000705\" target=_blank>cyproheptadine</a> may be used to reduce blistering in some individuals with the Dowling-Meara type of EBS. <a href=\"http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/sec10/ch110/ch110a.html\" target=_blank>Keratolytics</a> and softening agents for hyperkeratosis (thickening of the skin)&nbsp;of the palms and soles&nbsp;may prevent tissue from thickening and cracking. Prevention of secondary complications (such as infection of blisters) may involve treatment with topical and/or systemic antibiotics or <a href=\"http://www.podiatrytoday.com/article/3156\" target=_blank>silver-impregnated dressings</a> or gels. Appropriate footwear and physical therapy may preserve ambulation in children with difficulty walking because of blistering and hyperkeratosis. Surveillance is recommended for infection and proper wound healing. Avoiding excessive heat, poorly fitting or coarse-textured clothing and footwear,&nbsp;and activities that traumatize the skin is typically recommended.[2916] Other treatments under investigation for epidermolysis bullosa include protein therapy and <a href=\"http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/medicine/genetherapy.shtml\" target=_blank>gene therapy</a>.[2918]","dateModified":"2011-01-19T15:51:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":2916,"authors":"Ellen G Pfendner and Anna L Bruckner","articleTitle":"Epidemolysis Bullosa Simplex","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"August 11, 2008","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1369/","dateAccessed":"2011-01-19T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":2918,"authors":"Kevin Berman","articleTitle":"Episdermolysis Bullosa","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"MedlinePlus","date":"October 31, 2008","url":"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001457.htm","dateAccessed":"2011-01-19T00:00:00"}]},{"questionId":3981,"questionText":"How can I find an expert who has knowledge&nbsp;and experience regarding&nbsp;a specific&nbsp;condition?","answerText":"Although there is no list of experts for rare diseases, a <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/FindAnExpert.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">fact sheet</a> is available on our Web site with tips for finding healthcare professionals and researchers who have experience with a particular condition.
