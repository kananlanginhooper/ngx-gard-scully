Other features of this condition include a narrow chest, short ribs, underdeveloped lungs, and an enlarged head with a large forehead and prominent, wide-spaced eyes. Most infants with thanatophoric dysplasia are stillborn or die shortly after birth from respiratory failure. A few affected individuals have survived into childhood with extensive medical help. Thanatophoric dysplasia is caused by mutations in the <span class=\"geneSymbol\"><em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FGFR3\" target=\"_blank\">FGFR3</a></em></span> gene. While this condition is considered to be&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>, virtually all cases have occurred in people with no history of the disorder in their family.[5691]\r\n<p>Two major forms of thanatophoric dysplasia have been described, type I and type II. Type I thanatophoric dysplasia is distinguished by the presence of curved thigh bones and flattened bones of the spine (platyspondyly). Type II thanatophoric dysplasia is characterized by straight thigh bones and a moderate to severe skull abnormality called a cloverleaf skull.[5691]</p>","dateModified":"2012-12-13T19:43:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6604,"questionText":"What causes thanatophoric dysplasia?","answerText":"Thanatophoric dysplasia is caused by mutations in the <span class=\"geneSymbol\"><em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FGFR3\" target=\"_blank\">FGFR3</a></em></span> gene.
