These tissues connect, support and surround other body parts and may include muscle, fat, blood vessels, <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=269462\" target=\"_blank\">lymph vessels</a>, nerves, <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=443577\" target=\"_blank\">tendons</a> and the lining of joints.
