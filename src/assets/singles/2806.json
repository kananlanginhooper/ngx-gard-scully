Without treatment, these cataracts often become progressively worse leading to dimming and blurriness of vision. The severity of the condition can vary significantly from person to person, even among members of the same family. Hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome is caused by changes (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>) in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FTL\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FTL</em></a> gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner.

He told us that except an eye surgery, no other treatment was needed as far as the hyperferritninemia is concerned. But I am wondering whether a risk of a gene mutation could happen leading to another iron disease. Moreover, neither my husband or me have that syndrome, is it normal?

","caseQuestions":[{"questionId":9665,"questionText":"How might hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome be treated?","answerText":"Signs and symptoms of hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome includes early onset (childhood to early adulthood) cataract. Apart from cataracts, the syndrome causes no symptoms. The condition does not cause iron to be stored in body tissues. Lab tests show high levels of ferritin in the blood, however iron and transferrin saturation levels are normal. Once the syndrome is diagnosed, treatment involves regular eye exams and cataract surgery if needed. Currently there are no treatments to stop or slow the cataracts.[9990]","dateModified":"2015-11-11T11:31:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":9990,"authors":"Tsantoula F1, Kioumi A, Germenis AE, Speletas M","articleTitle":"Hereditary hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome as a cause of childhood hyperferritinemia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Pediatr Hematol Oncol","date":"2014 Jul","volume":"36(5)","pages":"e304-6","url":"","dateAccessed":"2015-11-11T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":9666,"questionText":"Are people with hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome at an increased risk for other iron disorders?","answerText":"No. People with hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome are not at an increased risk for other iron storage disorders.","dateModified":"2015-11-11T11:32:00","references":[]},{"questionId":9667,"questionText":"Is it unusual for a person with hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome to have unaffected parents?","answerText":"Yes.\r\nMost people with hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome inherit the\r\ncondition from an affected parent.
