It is a very rare disease and very few patients&nbsp;have been reported to date. Age of onset ranges from the early teens to the mid 20s and life span is normal. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms and is confirmed by genetic testing finding a change (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a>) in the  <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TTBK2\" target=\"_blank\"><em>TTBK2</em> gene</a>.
