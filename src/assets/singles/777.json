AMC is thought to be related to decreased fetal movement during development, which can occur for a variety of reasons.[8105][8106] When a joint is not moved for a period of time, extra connective tissue may grow around it, fixing it in place. Lack of joint movement also means that tendons connected to the joint are not stretched to their normal length, which can make normal joint movement difficult.[666]\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn general, there are four causes for decreased fetal movement before birth:[666]\r\n</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Abnormal development of muscles. In most cases, the specific cause for this cannot be identified. Suspected causes include muscle diseases, maternal fever during pregnancy, and viruses which may damage the cells that transmit nerve impulses to the muscles.</li>\r\n    <li>Insufficient room in the uterus for normal movement. For example, multiple fetuses may be present, the mother may lack normal amounts of amniotic fluid or there may be uterine structural abnormalities.</li>\r\n    <li>Malformations of the central nervous system (the brain and/or spinal cord). In these cases, arthrogryposis is usually accompanied by a wide range of other symptoms.</li>\r\n    <li>Tendons, bones, joints or joint linings may develop abnormally.
