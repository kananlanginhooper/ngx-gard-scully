Not all infants exposed to phenytoin will be affected with the disorder. Symptoms in affected individuals may include abnormalities of the skull and facial features, growth deficiencies, underdeveloped nails of the fingers and toes, and/or mild developmental delays. Other findings occasionally associated with this syndrome include <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/cleftlipandpalate.html\" target=_blank>cleft lip and palate</a>, having an&nbsp;abnormally small head (<a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/microcephaly/microcephaly.htm\" target=_blank>microcephaly</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/brainmalformations.html\" target=_blank>brain malformations</a> with more significant developmental delays.[4058] Treatment may include surgery for cleft lip and palate and&nbsp;special education and related services for children with learning delays.
