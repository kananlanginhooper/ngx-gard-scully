Kidney stones, the most common clinical manifestation of APRT deficiency, can occur at any age; in at least 50% of affected persons symptoms do not occur until adulthood. If adequate treatment is not provided, approximately 20%-25% of affected individuals develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD), usually in adult life.","Disease__c":"Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C0268120","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
