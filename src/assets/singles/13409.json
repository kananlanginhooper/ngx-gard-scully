The sleep apnea may be due to a collapse of the airway when breathing (<a href=\"http://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions/t/tracheomalacia\">tracheomalacia</a>). Other signs and symptoms may include autistic features, seizures, lack of coordination (ataxia), behavioral problems, crossed-eyes (strabismus), and an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine (scoliosis).[14750][14751][14753] Males usually have more severe symptoms than females.
