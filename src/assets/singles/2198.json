Symptoms are present at birth and tend to get worse over time. These include low muscle tone, spasms of the arms and legs, seizures, and developmental delay. Blood vessel damage causes tiny red spots under the skin (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003235.htm\" target=\"_blank\">petechiae</a>) and blue discoloration in the hands and feet due to reduced blood flow (<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=acrocyanosis\" target=\"_blank\">acrocyanosis</a>). Chronic bloody diarrhea and difficulty swallowing leads to poor growth. EE is considered a lethal condition, and most people die in childhood. Ethylmalonic encephalopathy is caused by a variant in the <em><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/ethe1\" target=\"_blank\">ETHE1</a></em> gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/illustrations/autorecessive\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, laboratory testing of blood and urine, and imaging studies of the brain. The result of genetic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is focused on support and managing the symptoms.[15845][15846][15847][15848]","dateModified":"2020-10-07T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13694,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of ethylmalonic encephalopathy?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with ethylmalonic encephalopathy.

The first symptom may be low muscle tone. Early development may be normal, but children with EE usually lose skills over time. Signs of blood vessel damage, such as red spots on the skin, usually appear in early childhood. People with EE develop spasms of the limbs and are often unable to walk without support. Swallowing difficulties and diarrhea lead to poor growth. Infectious illnesses can cause the neurological symptoms to get worse. Most people with EE die in childhood.
