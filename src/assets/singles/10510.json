It is a progressive disorder that causes the breakdown of brain cells&nbsp;in certain areas of the brain. This results in uncontrolled movements, loss of intellectual abilities, and emotional disturbances. Juvenile HD is defined by the onset of symptoms before age 20 years and accounts for 5-10% of all HD cases. It is inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>&nbsp;pattern and is caused by a type of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a>  called a <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=trinucleotiderepeat\" target=\"_blank\">trinucleotide repeat</a>, in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HTT\" target=\"_blank\">HTT</a></em> gene.

Juvenile HD, like adult-onset HD, causes loss of thinking abilities, personality changes, impaired coordination, and emotional problems. Children and adolescents with juvenile HD often have a rapid decline in school performance as their ability to think and reason is weakened. Other common symptoms include dystonia, tremors, muscle twitching (myoclonus), stiffness of the leg muscles, clumsiness, slurred speech, and swallowing problems. Experiencing all of these symptoms can lead to feelings of anger, frustration, sadness, and fear, and may also lead to aggressive behavior. In some cases, behavior problems are the first symptom in a teenager with juvenile HD. Unlike in people with adult-onset HD, seizures are common (especially in children who have symptoms before age 10), and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.movementdisorders.org/MDS/About/Movement-Disorder-Overviews/Chorea--Huntingtons-Disease.htm\" target=\"_blank\">chorea</a> may be only mild or not present at all.

However in some cases, the family history \"appears\" negative.

If the family history is truly negative, other causes for the child's symptoms may be explored.
