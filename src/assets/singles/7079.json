MSA affects several areas of the brain, including the cerebellum, which is involved in controlling movement and some emotions, as well as certain types of learning and memory, and the autonomic nervous system, which controls your body&rsquo;s automatic, or regulating functions, such as blood pressure, digestion and temperature.The initial symptoms of MSA start around age 50, and are very similar to the initial symptoms of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/parkinsonsdisease.html\">Parkinson&rsquo;s disease</a>. These symptoms&nbsp;may include&nbsp; slowness of movement, tremor, or rigidity (stiffness),&nbsp;clumsiness or coordination problems, difficulties with speech, orthostatic hypotension (a condition in which blood pressure drops when rising from a seated or lying down position), and&nbsp; bladder control problems. Other symptoms of MSA may include muscle contractures, abnormal posture,  bending of the neck, involuntary sighing, trouble sleeping and emotional problems. As MSA progresses,  breathing problems while sleeping (sleep apnea) and irregular heart rhythms may develop.[2601][2602]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMSA may be divided in 2 subtypes,&nbsp;&nbsp;depending on the main symptoms at the time when a person with MSA is evaluated:[2602]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>the parkinsonian type (MSA-P), which have Parkinson disease-like symptoms, such as moving slowly, stiffness, and tremor, along with problems of balance, coordination, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction</li>\r\n    <li>the cerebellar type (MSA-C), with primary symptoms of cerebellar ataxia (cerebellum is the part of the brain that is responsible for movement&nbsp; coordination) such as problems with balance and coordination, difficulty swallowing and speaking,  and abnormal eye movements&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe cause of MSA is unknown, although environmental toxins, trauma, and genetic factors may be involved. Most cases occur at random, without any other cases in the family.&nbsp;Diagnosis of MSA is suggested by a combination of symptoms, physical examination, lab test results, and response to certain medications. However, no laboratory or imaging studies are able to confirm the diagnosis.[14126]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment may include medication, physical, occupational, and speech therapy, and nutritional support. There is no cure for MSA, and there is no known way to prevent the disease from getting worse. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms.[2601][2603][14125][14128] Most people with MSA survive between 6-15 years after symptoms first begin.<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">[14127]</span>","dateModified":"2017-12-03T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12959,"relatedDiseaseName":"Primary orthostatic hypotension","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
