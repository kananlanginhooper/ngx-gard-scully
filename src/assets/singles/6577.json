Symptoms can vary depending on the metal involved, the amount absorbed, and the age of the person exposed.[13375] For example, young children are more susceptible to the effects of lead exposure because they absorb more compared with adults and their brains are still developing.[13375] Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common symptoms of acute metal ingestion. Chronic exposure may cause various symptoms resulting from damage to body organs, and may increase the risk of cancer.[13375] Treatment depends on the circumstances of the exposure.<br />","dateModified":"2017-04-28T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6743,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of heavy metal poisoning?","answerText":"Signs and symptoms of heavy metal poisoning vary depending on the type and amount of metal involved.[5837] Fetuses and young children are at the highest risk for severe and long term health consequences from heavy metal exposure.[5837] Early symptoms may be missed because they are often nonspecific.
