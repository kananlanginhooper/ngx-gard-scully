Signs and symptoms of r(14) syndrome vary from person to person but often include distinctive facial features, developmental delay and intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder,&nbsp;intractable (hard to control) epilepsy, and occasional eye and vision abnormalities. Intellectual disability ranges from moderate to severe, likely depending on the severity of seizures and age they begin (earlier onset&nbsp;is associated with more severe disability). Severity and frequency of seizures may improve over time. Other signs and symptoms may include a small head size (microcephaly), low muscle tone (hypotonia), <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001241.htm\" target=\"_blank\">scoliosis</a>, and increased susceptibility to infections.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRing chromosomes almost always occur sporadically (by chance), occurring for the first time in people with no family history of chromosome disorders.[14634][14635] In these cases, it occurs as a random event when egg or sperm cells are formed,  or very soon after the egg and sperm join together.[14635] Researchers believe that several important genes near the end of the long arm of chromosome 14 are lost (deleted) when the ring forms, likely leading to some of the features of r(14) syndrome.[14635] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nManagement depends on the symptoms in each person and often requires a team of specialists to address each medical issue. Because symptoms and severity can vary, the long-term outlook (prognosis) is difficult to predict  and depends mainly on the health issues present and complications that may arise.[14634]","dateModified":"2018-05-15T16:06:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
