This process is called <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/osteonecrosis.html\" target=\"_blank\">osteonecrosis</a>. Symptoms include pain, swelling, limited movement, and decreased grip strength. The symptoms usually start in adulthood, but can occur at any age. Kienbock's disease usually slowly gets worse over time.  The underlying cause of Kienbock's disease is unknown. Diagnosis is made by imaging studies such as an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/mriscans.html\" target=\"_blank\">MRI</a> or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ctscans.html\" target=\"_blank\">CT scan</a>. Treatment aims to relieve pressure and restore blood flow within the bone, and includes both surgical and non-surgical methods.[15620][15621][15623]","dateModified":"2020-06-03T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":8272,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Kienbock's disease?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with Kienbock's disease.
