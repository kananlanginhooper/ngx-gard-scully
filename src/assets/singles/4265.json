A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Because females have two copies of the X chromosome, one altered copy of the gene in each cell usually leads to less severe symptoms in females than in males, or may cause no symptoms at all. A striking characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.[1263]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one altered copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier.

Within the first year of life, those affected with classic Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease typically experience weak muscle tone (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003298.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypotonia</a>), involuntary movements of the eyes (<a href=\"http://www.aoa.org/x9763.xml\" target=\"_blank\">nystagmus</a>), and delayed development of motor skills such as crawling or walking.

A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Because females have two copies of the X chromosome, one altered copy of the gene in each cell usually leads to less severe symptoms in females than in males, or may cause no symptoms at all. A striking characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.[1263]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one altered copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier.
