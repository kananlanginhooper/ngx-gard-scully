There is also an exteremely rare form called telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans. The&nbsp;signs, symptoms and severity of the condition vary by subtype.[8369][8371][8387] Cutaneous mastocytosis is usually caused by changes (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>) in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/KIT\" target=\"_blank\"><em>KIT</em></a> gene.

There is also an exteremely rare form called telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans.[8371][8372]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis, the most common form of cutaneous mastocytosis, is characterized by itchy, brown patches on the skin. Although these patches may be mistaken for freckles or bug bites&nbsp;initially, they typically persist and gradually increase in number over several months to years. In&nbsp;young children, the patches may form a blister if itched or rubbed. Itching may worsen with changes in temperature, strenuous activity, emotional stress, and/or certain medications. Maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis is most commonly seen in infants and young children and often fades by the teenaged years. In some cases, this condition may not develop until adulthood. These later onset cases generally last long-term and&nbsp;are more likely to&nbsp;progress to <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/8616/systemic-mastocytosis/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">systemic mastocytosis</a>.[8371][8372][8370]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSolitary cutaneous mastocytoma is a localized form of cutaneous mastocytosis. Like maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis, this form is typically diagnosed in young children. However, it is characterized by an itchy area of reddish or brown skin that is often thickened. When itched, these patches of skin may swell, redden, and/or blister. This form typically resolves spontaneously with age.[8371][8372][8368]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiffuse cutaneous mastocytosis, the most severe form of cutaneous mastocytosis, usually develops in infancy. Unlike the other forms of cutaneous mastocytosis, it affects most or all of the skin rather than appearing as distinct patches. In people affected by this condition, the skin is leathery and thickened. It may appear normal, yellowish-brown, or red in color. In some cases, there may also be widespread blistering. Additional symptoms may include <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007278.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypotension</a>, diarrhea, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003133.htm\" target=\"_blank\">gastrointestinal bleeding</a>, reddening of the skin (flushing), and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000844.htm\" target=\"_blank\">anaphylactic shock</a>.[8369][8371][8372]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe rarest form of cutaneous mastocytosis is called telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans.
