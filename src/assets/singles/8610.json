The asymmetrical facial sweating and flushing associated with this condition has been named the &ldquo;Harlequin sign.&rdquo; Harlequin syndrome is thought to be one of a spectrum of diseases that can cause Harlequin sign.[5715] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe exact cause of Harlequin syndrome is not completely understood. In some patients with this syndrome, the underlying cause seems to be a lesion or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001310.htm\">tumor</a> that is affecting the ability of the cells of the autonomic nervous system to communicate with one side of the body.[5715] However, in many cases an exact cause of the symptoms is not found.[7849]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiagnosis of Harlequin syndrome is based on observing symptoms consistent with the syndrome, followed by a series of tests to rule out other diseases associated with Harlequin sign.[5715][7849] Treatment may consist of removing any lesion that may be causing the symptoms of the syndrome. If no lesion is present and the syndrome is not interfering with a person&rsquo;s daily living, treatment may not be necessary.[548]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2017-08-01T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":878,"questionText":"What symptoms are associated with Harlequin syndrome?","answerText":"Harlequin syndrome may be associated with warmth on the flushed side of the body and lack of sweating (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003219.htm\">anhidrosis</a>) on the opposite side of the body (contralateral side). The signs and symptoms of Harlequin syndrome may begin at any age and have been reported in children or from birth in some cases.[5716][13661] Symptoms may be caused by exercise, heat, spicy foods, or intense emotional situations.[13659][548]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome people with the Harlequin sign may have other symptoms including <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000786.htm\">cluster headaches</a>, tearing of the eyes, nasal discharge, forehead sweating, abnormal contraction of the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/9312.htm\">pupils</a>, and drooping of the upper eyelid (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/1111.htm\">ptosis</a>).
