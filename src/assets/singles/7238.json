Toxoplamosis can be&nbsp;acquired or present at birth (congenital), having crossed the placenta from a newly infected mother to her fetus. Most humans acquire toxoplasmosis by eating raw or undercooked meat, vegetables or milk products, or by coming into contact with infected cat litterbox or sandboxes.&nbsp;In humans,&nbsp;the infection&nbsp;usually causes no symptoms, and resolves without treatment in a few months. In individuals with compromised immune systems, <em>Toxoplasm a gondii </em>can reactivate to cause disease.[3993]&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReactivation of a congenital infection was traditionally thought to be the most common cause of&nbsp;ocular toxoplasmosis, but an acquired infection is now considered to be more common.[12697] A toxoplasmosis infection that affects the eye usually attacks the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002291.htm\" target=\"_blank\">retina</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;initially resolves without symptoms. However,&nbsp;the inactive parasite may&nbsp;later&nbsp;reactivate causing eye&nbsp;pain, blurred vision, and possibly permanent damage, including blindness.
