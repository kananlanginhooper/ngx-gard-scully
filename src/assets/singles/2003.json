Two other phenotypes included a \"pseudometabolic myopathy\" and \"asymptomatic hyperCKemia\" which were found in 10% and 5% of the patients respectively.[187]</p>","dateModified":"2013-07-12T12:54:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":186,"authors":"Aoki M","articleTitle":"Dysferlinopathy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"2004","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1303/","dateAccessed":"2008-02-18T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":187,"authors":"Nguyen K","articleTitle":"Phenotypic study in 40 patients with dysferlin gene mutations: High frequency of atypical phenotypes","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Arch Neurol","date":"2007"},{"referenceId":188,"authors":"Bushby KMD, Straub V, Lochmuller H, Eagle M, Guglieri M, Hastings L","articleTitle":"Limb girdle muscular dystrophy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Muscular Dystrophy Campaign","date":"","url":"http://mdausa.org/disease/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy/overview","dateAccessed":"2008-02-18T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":189,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystropy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"The Muscular Dystrophy Association","date":"","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://mda.org/disease/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":192,"authors":"Ueyama H. et al","articleTitle":"Clinical heterogeneity in dysferlinopathy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Internal Medicine","date":"2002"}]},{"questionId":286,"questionText":"What is the prognosis for patients with a dysferlinopathy?","answerText":"In a previous series of patients with Miyoshi myopathy, 8 of 24 required a wheelchair after a 10-year-disease duration.
