It is made up of abnormal blood vessels and tough, fibrous, fatty tissue. It most often involves a single limb, which may appear slightly enlarged. Common signs and symptoms include pain, loss of mobility, and visible veins. Diagnosis is often delayed till late childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. In some cases, the anomaly is due to changes in the PIK3CA gene. In other cases the cause is not known. FAVA is not inherited. Treatment may involve surgery or freezing (cryoablation), and physical therapy.  If surgery or cryoablation cannot be done, the medication, Sirolimus, may be another treatment option.[12207]","dateModified":"2016-09-14T12:31:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
