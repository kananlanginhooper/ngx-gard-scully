In some cases, a carcinoid tumor develops in another part of the body, such as the pancreas,  testicle (in men), or ovary (in women). It is a slow-growing tumor that typically does not cause symptoms in the early stages, so a person may have the tumor for years before being diagnosed. In later stages, symptoms may vary depending on where the tumor is located.[1678][5150][14336] Symptoms of a GI carcinoid tumor may only develop if the tumor has spread to the liver. The tumor may produce hormone-like substances that spread to the body and cause symptoms of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.rarediseases.org/search/rdbdetail_abstract.html?disname=Carcinoid%20Syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">carcinoid syndrome</a>, such as&nbsp;flushing of the face and chest, diarrhea, and trouble breathing. People with a lung carcinoid tumor are less likely to have carcinoid syndrome, but may experience coughing, wheezing, or pneumonia.[5150] The tumor may also cause various symptoms if it has spread to other parts of the body.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cause of carcinoid tumors is unknown, but certain unavoidable risk factors may increase a person's chance of developing a carcinoid tumor.[5150] In general, cancer develops when a cell randomly develops mutations in its DNA.[14337] Surgery to remove the tumor is the main treatment and can typically cure the tumor if it has not spread to other parts of the body.[1678] Other treatment options may include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/targeted-therapy\" target=\"_blank\">targeted therapy</a>.[5150]","dateModified":"2018-02-13T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6118,"questionText":"What causes carcinoid tumors?","answerText":"The cause of carcinoid tumors is currently unknown.
