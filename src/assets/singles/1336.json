In this chromosome abnormality,&nbsp;a segment on the short (p) arm and a segment on the long (q) arm of 22 are missing. The amount of material lost varies from person to person. The remaining ends of chromosome 22 have joined together to make a ring shape. Chromosome 22 is an <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=acrocentric\" target=_blank>acrocentric chromosome</a>, meaning that the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=centromere\" target=_blank>centromere</a>&nbsp;is near one end, creating a very small short (p) arm that does not contain <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/basics/gene\" target=_blank>genes</a> that are relevant to development. Thus, only the lost genes on the long (q) arm matter. Knowing the breakpoint in the long arm is likely more helpful. Most cases are sporadic (happen by chance) and occur in people with no history of the condition in their family.[3803]","dateModified":"2011-07-11T13:25:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":4848,"questionText":"What&nbsp;are the signs and&nbsp;symptoms of ring chromosome 22?","answerText":"<p>The associated signs and symptoms depend largely on where the breakpoint occurs&nbsp;on chromosome 22 and how much genetic material has been lost on the long (q) arm. Genetic material lost on the short (p) arm is usually irrelevant and does not cause physical or intellectual features. The breakpoints on the long (q)&nbsp;arm can be&nbsp;difficult to determine; but in ring chromosome 22, they are most likely to happen somewhere in the terminal segment of the distal band 22q13.[3804] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn general,&nbsp;there is limited information on how chromosome abnormalities like&nbsp;ring chromosome&nbsp;22 impact growth and development. Since each abnormality is usually so rare, there are few cases to learn from, let alone conduct research.&nbsp;It is generally difficult to say what the future will hold for affected individuals, because even when the chromosome abnormalities are similar, the health problems can vary widely.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver 100 cases have been reported on ring chromosome 22. While there is no consistent clinical picture, frequent findings of ring chromosome 22 include <a href=\"http://nichcy.org/disability/specific/dd\" target=\"_blank\">developmental delay</a>, moderate to severe learning difficulties or <a href=\"http://nichcy.org/disability/specific/intellectual\" target=\"_blank\">intellectual disabilities</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003272.htm\" target=\"_blank\">small head</a>, absent or delayed speech, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003298.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypotonia</a>, unsteady manner of walking, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003256.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hyperactivity</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/autism/detail_autism.htm#179493082\" target=\"_blank\">autistic behaviors</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003200.htm\" target=\"_blank\">seizures</a>, and growth delay.
