These drugs&nbsp;relax the muscles used for movement, including those used for breathing. Normally, the muscles are able to move again a few minutes after the drugs are given. People with pseudocholinesterase deficiency may not be able to move or breathe on their own for a few hours after these drugs are given. They therefore may need mechanical ventilation until the drugs are cleared from the body. People with this condition may also have increased sensitivity to other types of drugs as well as to some agricultural pesticides.[6276]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPseudocholinesterase deficiency can be inherited (genetic) or acquired.
