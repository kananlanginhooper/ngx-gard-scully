It is the most common birth defect of the hand and foot. Polydactyly can occur as an isolated finding such that the person has no other physical anomalies or intellectual impairment. However, it can occur in association with other birth defects and cognitive abnormalities as part of a genetic syndrome.&nbsp;In some cases, the extra digits may be well-formed and functional. Surgery may be considered especially for poorly formed digits or very large extra digits.&nbsp;Surgical management depends greatly on the complexity of the deformity.[8861][8862]<br />","dateModified":"2015-05-08T12:57:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12769,"relatedDiseaseName":"Central polydactyly of fingers","relation":"Child","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":12460,"relatedDiseaseName":"Postaxial polydactyly of the fingers","relation":"Child","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":12770,"relatedDiseaseName":"Postaxial polydactyly of toes ","relation":"Child","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":12767,"relatedDiseaseName":"Preaxial polydactyly of fingers","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":12771,"relatedDiseaseName":"Preaxial polydactyly of toes","relation":"Child","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":false}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
