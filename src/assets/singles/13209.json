Later in childhood, signs may include short stature, seizures, low arterial pressure (hypotension) and/or intellectual delay.[12986] Some people can also have vision problems (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/septo-optic-dysplasia\" target=\"_blank\">septooptic dysplasia</a>) and <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/fanconi-anemia\" target=\"_blank\">Fanconi anemia</a>.
