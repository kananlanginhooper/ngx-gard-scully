Signs and symptoms include sweating blood, crying bloody tears, bleeding from the nose, bleeding from the ears, or oozing blood&nbsp;from other skin surfaces.  The episodes are usually self-limiting. In some cases, the  fluid appears to be blood tinged, while others  resemble frank blood. It can occur on any part of the body, but most commonly appears on the face (ear, nose, and eyes). The cause is unknown. The bleeding is due to the rupture of the very small blood vessels of the skin (dermal capillaries).[12489] Some theories  include increased vascular pressure leading to the passage of blood cells through the ducts of the sweat glands, inflammation of the vessels of the skin (vasculitis of dermal vessels), and&nbsp;intensified <a href=\"https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/auto.html\">sympathetic activation</a>.[12490] Some cases are associated with systemic disease, <a href=\"https://www.hemophilia.org/Bleeding-Disorders\" target=\"_blank\">bleeding disorders</a>, menstruation, excessive exertion, <a href=\"high blood pressure\" target=\"_blank\">high blood pressure</a>, fear and intense emotional stress.[12489][12490][12491][12492] Treatment  remains a challenge, and may include vitamin C, <a href=\"http://williams.medicine.wisc.edu/hemostatics.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">hemostatic drugs</a>, <a href=\"https://ons.org/intervention/anxiolytics-0\" target=\"_blank\">anxiolytics</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/depression/depression-medications-antidepressants\" target=\"_blank\">antidepressants</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682607.html\" target=\"_blank\">propranolol</a>.[12489][12490][12491] Resolution of symptoms may occur spontaneously.[12489]<br />","dateModified":"2016-10-31T22:55:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
