These adrenal gland hormones are necessary for balancing water and energy in the body. Symptoms usually develop slowly over time, and may include fatigue, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and dark patches of skin. Sometimes symptoms occur suddenly causing a life-threatening condition called acute adrenal failure, also known as an acute adrenal crisis. Symptoms of an acute adrenal crisis include sudden weakness, pain, and fainting. The most common cause of Addison's disease is an abnormal response of the body&rsquo;s immune system. Injury to the adrenal gland can also cause Addison's disease. Diagnosis is based on the the symptoms, blood and urine tests that evaluate adrenal function, and imaging studies. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms and includes daily medications that replace the adrenal hormones. Treatment for an adrenal crisis may include intravenous hydrocortisone, fluids, and electrolytes, as well as drugs that normalize blood pressure.[14463][15789][15791]","dateModified":"2020-09-09T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13639,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Addison's disease?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with Addison's disease.
