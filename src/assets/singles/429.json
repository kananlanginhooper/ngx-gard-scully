The amnion is the sac that surrounds the baby in the womb. As the baby develops in the womb, the bands may attach to and affect the development of different areas of the body. This may result in constriction of the affected area or even amputation. The signs and symptoms vary greatly depending on the area(s) of the body involved and may include: shortened or absent digits (fingers and/or toes) or limbs (arms and/or legs), an opening in the abdomen through which various abdominal organs can protrude (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/abdominal-wall-defect\" target=\"_blank\">abdominal wall defects</a>), protrusion of a portion of the brain and its surrounding membranes  through a skull defect (<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6333/encephalocele\" target=\"_blank\">encephalocele</a>), and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cleftlipandpalate.html\" target=\"_blank\">cleft lip and/or palate</a>. In most instances, the cause of amniotic bands remains unknown. Researchers have suggested two main theories to explain the development: the extrinsic theory and the intrinsic theory. The extrinsic theory states that amniotic band syndrome occurs due to factors found outside of the developing baby (externally); the intrinsic theory states that amniotic band syndrome occurs due to factors found within the baby (internally). Treatment differs depending on the severity of the condition and the areas of the body affected and may include surgery, physical therapy, and occupational therapy.[576][13231][13232]","dateModified":"2017-03-21T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":954,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of amniotic band syndrome?","answerText":"The symptoms of amniotic band syndrome depend on the severity and location of the constrictions. The mildest constrictions affect only the superficial skin and may not require treatment. Deeper constrictions may block lymphatic vessels, impair blood flow, and require immediate surgical care.[576] When the bands affect the limbs, the lower part of the limbs are most often involved, especially the middle, long, and index fingers of the hand. When the feet are involved, the bands most commonly affect the big toe.[576]\r\n<p>Pressure from the bands may result in additional abnormalities, such as underdevelopment of a limb, bone abnormalities, amputations, leg-length discrepancy, and club feet. Constriction bands across the head and face may lead to facial clefts.
