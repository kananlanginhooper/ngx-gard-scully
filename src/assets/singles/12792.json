It is considered a \"fibro-osseous <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?CdrID=46264\" target=\"_blank\">neoplasm</a>\" because it is characterized by an overgrowth of bone. Affected people generally experience a gradual or rapid, painless expansion of the affected bone or region. Other symptoms such as <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003033.htm\" target=\"_blank\">exophthalmos</a> or nasal blockage can rarely be associated with the tumor depending on its exact location. In some cases, the condition can be particularly aggressive with rapid growth and significant facial disfigurement. Although the condition can affect people of all ages, it is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 5 and 15. The exact underlying cause is currently unknown; however, most cases occur <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/sporadic/\" target=\"_blank\">sporadically</a>  in people with no family history of the condition. JOF is usually treated with surgery. Because the recurrence rate of JOF ranges from 30% to 58%, continued follow-up is essential.[9728][9729]","dateModified":"2015-10-01T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":9710,"authors":"Tayfur M & cols","articleTitle":"Bilateral synchronous ossifying fibromas of the mandible: a case report","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Int J Clin Exp Pathol","date":"2015","volume":"8(5)","pages":"5844–5847","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26191307","dateAccessed":"2015-09-28T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9711,"authors":"Foss RD & Fielding CG","articleTitle":"Juvenile Psammomatoid Ossifying Fibroma","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Head Neck Pathol","date":"September, 2007","volume":"1(1)","pages":"33–34.","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2807504/","dateAccessed":"2015-09-28T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
