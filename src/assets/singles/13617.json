The abnormal flutter of the diaphragm affects the way the lungs can expand and contract during breathing.[14933] Symptoms of diaphragmatic flutter may include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003075.htm\" target=\"_blank\">difficulty breathing</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/abdominalpain.html\" target=\"_blank\">abdominal pain</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003081.htm\" target=\"_blank\">heart palpitations</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/chestpain.html\" target=\"_blank\">chest pain</a>. Symptoms usually worsen during the day and with stress.[14934] Diaphragmatic flutter often occurs in combination with contraction of other&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\">muscles used to breath</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0022182/\" target=\"_blank\">respiratory muscles</a>).[14933]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cause of diaphragmatic flutter is not well understood.
