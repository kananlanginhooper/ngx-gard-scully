This is the most common hereditary form of dystonia.[12481]&nbsp;Symptoms start in one part of the body (usually an arm, foot, or leg) and are usually first apparent with actions such as writing or walking. With time, the contractions may spread to other parts of the body, causing the muscles to twist the body into unnatural positions.[12481][12482][12483] Symptoms can vary greatly, even among members of the same family. For some, the disorder can cause significant disability, while others may experiences only isolated writer&rsquo;s cramp.[12481][12483] A small deletion in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TOR1A#synonyms\" target=\"_blank\">DYT1</a></em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TOR1A#synonyms\" target=\"_blank\"> gene</a> is the major cause of early-onset dystonia.[12482][12483] The genetic change responsible for early onset generalized dystonia is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>  manner, though not everyone who inherits the genetic change will develop the condition.
