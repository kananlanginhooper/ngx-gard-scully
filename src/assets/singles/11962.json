Specifically, fat is lost in the arms, legs, and hips, and gained around the face and liver. Symptoms usually develop around puberty and include problems breaking down food and resistance to the hormone that helps control blood sugar (<a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/treatment-and-care/medication/insulin/insulin-basics.html\" target=\"_blank\">insulin</a>). <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/types/prediabetes-insulin-resistance\" target=\"_blank\">Insulin resistance</a> can eventually lead to <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001214.htm\" target=\"_blank\">diabetes</a>. Other symptoms may include inflammation of the pancreas (<a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/liver-disease/pancreatitis/Pages/facts.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">pancreatitis</a>), heart problems, and high blood pressure (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000468.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypertension</a>). There are at least six subtypes of FPLD.

These genes are responsible for making proteins that play an important role in fat storage. Changes in any of these genes can reduce or eliminate the function of the proteins they produce. This impairs the development, structure, or function of the fat cells (adipocytes), making them unable to properly store and use fats.[12340] The condition can be inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>&nbsp;manner.[12340][12341] Treatment may require a team of specialists who can monitor the patient for any health changes and prescribe a special diet and medication to treat the symptoms of the disease.[12341]","dateModified":"2016-10-08T23:08:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12601,"relatedDiseaseName":"Familial partial lipodystrophy associated with PLIN1 mutations","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":12600,"relatedDiseaseName":"Familial partial lipodystrophy associated with PPARG mutations","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12599,"relatedDiseaseName":"Familial partial lipodystrophy due to AKT2 mutations","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":3126,"relatedDiseaseName":"Familial partial lipodystrophy type 2","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12598,"relatedDiseaseName":"Familial partial lipodystrophy type KÃ¶bberling","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12597,"relatedDiseaseName":"Genetic lipodystrophy","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":13126,"relatedDiseaseName":"LIPE-related familial partial lipodystrophy","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":13125,"relatedDiseaseName":"Lipodystrophy, familial partial, type 5","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
