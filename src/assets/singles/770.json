However, in some cases new symptoms may develop as side effects to other symptoms. For example, some people with AADC deficiency may develop <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003185.htm\">joint contractures</a> (inability to move joints) due to the movement disorders associated with the disease.[13587] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of the symptoms associated with AADC deficiency, such as problems controlling the <a href=\"http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/brain-spinal-cord-and-nerve-disorders/autonomic-nervous-system-disorders/overview-of-the-autonomic-nervous-system\">autonomic nervous system</a>, may be life-threatening in moments of stress. It is important to follow the doctor&rsquo;s recommendations for monitoring the symptoms of people with AADC deficiency and to know what to do in case of an emergency.[13587]&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />","dateModified":"2017-07-14T10:26:00","resourceClassificationName":"Prognosis","references":[{"referenceId":13587,"authors":"Wassenberg T, Molero-Luis M, Jeltsch K, Hoffmann G, Assmann B, Blau N, Garcia-Carzola A, Artuch R, Pons R, Pearson TS, Leuzzi V, Mastrangelo M, Pearl PL, Lee WT, Kurian MA, Heales S, Flint L, Verbeek M, Willemsen M, and Opladen T","articleTitle":"Consensus guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases","date":"2017","volume":"12:12","pages":"","url":"https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13023-016-0522-z?site=ojrd.biomedcentral.com","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13588,"authors":"Helman G, Pappa MB, and Pearl PL","articleTitle":"Widening Phenotypic Spectrum of AADC Deficiency, a Disorder of Dopamine and Serotonin Synthesis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"JIMD Reports","date":"2014","volume":"17","pages":"23-27","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4241195/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[{"referenceId":13586,"authors":"Chien YH, Chen PW, Lee NC, Hsieh WS, Chiu PC, Hwu WL, Tsai FJ, Lin SP, Chu SY, Jong YJ, and Chao MC","articleTitle":"3-O-methyldopa levels in newborns: Result of newborn screening for aromatic l-aminio acid decarboxylase deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Molecular Genetics and Metabolism","date":"August 2016","volume":"118(4)","pages":"259-263","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27216367","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13587,"authors":"Wassenberg T, Molero-Luis M, Jeltsch K, Hoffmann G, Assmann B, Blau N, Garcia-Carzola A, Artuch R, Pons R, Pearson TS, Leuzzi V, Mastrangelo M, Pearl PL, Lee WT, Kurian MA, Heales S, Flint L, Verbeek M, Willemsen M, and Opladen T","articleTitle":"Consensus guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases","date":"2017","volume":"12:12","pages":"","url":"https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13023-016-0522-z?site=ojrd.biomedcentral.com","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13588,"authors":"Helman G, Pappa MB, and Pearl PL","articleTitle":"Widening Phenotypic Spectrum of AADC Deficiency, a Disorder of Dopamine and Serotonin Synthesis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"JIMD Reports","date":"2014","volume":"17","pages":"23-27","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4241195/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
