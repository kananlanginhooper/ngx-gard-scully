This is also called iron overload. Accumulation of iron in the organs is toxic and can cause organ damage. While many organs can be affected, iron overload is especially likely to affect the liver, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bloodheartandcirculation.html\">heart</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/8883.htm\">pancreas</a>.[1364] Hemochromatosis type 4 can be further divided into two subtypes:[14364]<br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\r\n    <li>Hemochromatosis type 4A</li>\r\n    <li>Hemochromatosis type 4B</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nPeople with hemochromatosis type 4A might not have any symptoms of the disease. Other individuals may develop <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/liverdiseases.html\">liver disease</a> as they get older.[14364] Hemochromatosis type 4B can be associated with <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fatigue.html\">fatigue</a>, weakness, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003261.htm\">joint pain</a>. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, loss of sex drive, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/liverdiseases.html\">liver disease</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001214.htm\">diabetes</a>, heart problems, difficulty breathing, and skin discoloration.[1364][14365] Symptoms of hemochromatosis type 4B can begin anytime from childhood to adulthood.[14364][14366] Hemochromatosis type 4 is most common in people of southern European ancestry.[14348]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHemochromatosis type 4 is caused by genetic changes (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\">mutations</a> or pathogenic variants) to the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SLC40A1\"><em>SLC40A1</em></a> <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/gene\">gene</a>.[14348][1365] The disease is inherited in an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002049.htm\">autosomal dominant</a> manner. A diagnosis of hemochromatosis type 4 is suspected when a doctor observes signs and symptoms of the disease. A doctor may decide to order laboratory tests including a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003895.htm\">liver biopsy</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003335.htm\">MRI</a>, or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003488.htm\">blood test</a>. The diagnosis can be confirmed with <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/testing/genetictesting\">genetic testing</a>.[1364] Treatment of hemochromatosis type 4B usually involves reducing iron levels by removing blood (<a href=\"http://www.irondisorders.org/phlebotomy\">phlebotomy</a>) or <a href=\"http://www.irondisorders.org/chelation-therapy\">iron chelation</a>. These treatments can prevent additional organ damage but typically do not reverse existing damage.[1364] People with hemochromatosis type 4A may not be recommended to have phlebotomy because it can increase the risk for complications such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/anemia.html\">anemia</a>.[14364]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo learn more about other types of hemochromatosis click on the disease names below:<br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10417/disease\">Hemochromatosis type 1</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Disease.aspx?diseaseID=10092\" target=\"_blank\">Hemochromatosis type 2</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10093/hemochromatosis-type-3\">Hemochromatosis type 3</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/13472/hemochromatosis-type-5\" target=\"_blank\">Hemochromatosis type 5</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Disease.aspx?diseaseID=7172\" target=\"_blank\">Neonatal hemochromatosis</a></li>\r\n</ul>","dateModified":"2018-02-18T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":12599,"questionText":"What causes hemochromatosis type 4?","answerText":"Hemochromatosis type 4 is caused by genetic changes (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\">mutations</a> or pathogenic variants) in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SLC40A1\"><em>SLC40A1</em></a> <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/gene\">gene</a>.[14364] This gene provides the body with instructions to make a protein called ferroportin.
