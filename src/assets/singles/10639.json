In general, gangliogliomas are&nbsp;classified as <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/detection/tumor-grade\" target=_blank>grade I or low grade tumors</a>, meaning that they grow slowly and are considered <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=45614\" target=_blank>benign</a>. Anaplastic gangliogliomas, however, are considered <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/detection/tumor-grade\" target=_blank>grade III or high grade tumors</a>, which means that they are usually aggressive, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002253.htm\" target=_blank>malignant</a> tumors. The main treatment is removal of the entire tumor during surgery.&nbsp; If the entire tumor is not removed, it has the potential to <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=46556\" target=_blank>recur</a>&nbsp;and may require additional surgery or treatments, such as <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=44971\" target=_blank>radiation therapy</a> or <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=45214\" target=_blank>chemotherapy</a>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, because gangliogliomas are quite rare, there is limited information to show that radiation therapy or chemotherapy are effective treatments for this condition.[3798]","dateModified":"2011-10-18T14:27:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
