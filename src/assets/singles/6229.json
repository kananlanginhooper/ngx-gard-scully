Neutrophils are instrumental in fighting off infection by surrounding and destroying bacteria that enter the body. Symptoms of cyclic&nbsp;neutropenia may include fever, a general feeling of ill health, and/or sores (ulcers) of the mucous membranes of the mouth. Individuals with low levels of neutrophils (neutropenia) are highly susceptible to recurrent infections.[2469] Cyclic&nbsp;neutropenia may be inherited or acquired. Some cases are present at birth and appear to occur randomly for no apparent reason (sporadic). Inherited cases appear to be transmitted in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> fashion&nbsp;and are caused by <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\">mutations</a> in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ELANE\" target=\"_blank\">ELANE</a></em>&nbsp;gene.[3630] Treatment includes prompt treatment of associated infections and and therapies aimed at stimulating the production of neutrophils, such as&nbsp;recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF).[2469]","dateModified":"2016-05-18T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":11749,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of cyclic neutropenia?","answerText":"The signs and symptoms of cyclic neutropenia usually appear at birth or shortly after. This condition is characterized by recurrent episodes of neutropenia that recur every 14-35 days (most commonly around 21 days) and last between 3 and 5 days. During times of neutropenia, it may be more difficult for the body to fight bacteria, viruses, and infections. The severity of the resulting infections can vary and are often similar to the severity of the neutropenia itself.&nbsp;Resulting symptoms during periods of neutropenia may include: &nbsp;<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Recurrent fever</li>\r\n    <li>Sore throat (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000655.htm\" target=\"_blank\">pharyngitis</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Inflammation of the gums (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001056.htm\" target=\"_blank\">gingivitis</a>)&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Inflamed and sore mouth (stomatitis)</li>\r\n    <li>Infections in the skin and in other areas of the body</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAdditionally, individuals with this condition are at greater risk to develop chronic mouth ulcers.
