This type of breast cancer is called &ldquo;inflammatory&rdquo; because the breast often looks swollen and red, or &ldquo;inflamed.&rdquo; The skin may also look dimpled like the skin of an orange. IBC can be difficult to diagnose because there is no lump to feel or detect on a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/detection/screening-mammograms\" target=\"_blank\">mammogram</a>. It is crucial to identify IBC right away because early diagnosis and treatment can greatly improve the outcome. Patients are often given a combination of treatments,&nbsp;including <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002324.htm\" target=\"_blank\">chemotherapy</a>, surgery, and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001918.htm\" target=\"_blank\">radiation therapy</a>. Approximately one-third of&nbsp;individuals diagnosed with IBC will become long-term survivors. Like other types of breast cancer, IBC can occur in men, but usually at an older age than in women. Some studies have shown an association between family history of breast cancer and IBC, but more studies are needed to draw firm conclusions.[1182]","dateModified":"2015-09-24T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":9590,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Types of Breast Cancer","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"American Cancer Society","date":"June 10, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.cancer.org/cancer/breastcancer/detailedguide/breast-cancer-breast-cancer-types","dateAccessed":"2015-09-03T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
