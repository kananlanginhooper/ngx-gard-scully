There is one case report (on an individual patient) that describes application of botulinum toxin (Botox) for pain relief in a person with PHA, which reportedly improved hair growth over the injection regions.[13064] However, one case report does not enable researchers to generalize the findings or establish that something is safe and effective for others.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMany researchers believe that PHA and a type of <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/9513/linear-scleroderma\" target=\"_blank\">linear scleroderma</a> called&nbsp;<em>en coup de sabre</em> (ECDS) are both manifestations of localized scleroderma. PHA and ECDS often coexist in one person. Hair loss (alopecia) is a feature of ECDS, and some scientists believe that the presence of alopecia may be used to distinguish (if desired) between ECDS and PHA.[13063] ECDS is associated specifically with cicatricial alopecia (also called scarring alopecia).[13065] This type of alopecia results from damaged hair follicles that are replaced with scar tissue, causing permanent hair loss.[13066] You can read about treatment for cicatricial alopecia on the <a href=\"https://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/Cicatricial_Alopecia/#5\">National Institutes of Health website here</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA hair restoration doctor can evaluate hair loss and recommend an appropriate treatment plan based on the underlying cause and extent of hair loss.&nbsp;Effective treatments for some types of hair loss are available, but in some cases hair loss is permanent.
