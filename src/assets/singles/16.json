Because of this, most patients with COMA have to turn their head in order to follow objects in side gaze. Typically, up-to-down (vertical) eye movements are unaffected.[3340][13260] Symptoms usually improve throughout the childhood and teenage years.[3340] COMA can also be associated with mild <a href=\"http://nichcy.org/disability/specific/dd\" target=\"_blank\">developmental delay</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;speech difficulties.
