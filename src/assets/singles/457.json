Achalasia is a disorder that affects the ability to move food through the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach. It can lead to severe feeding difficulties and low blood sugar (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hypoglycemia.html\" target=\"_blank\">hypoglycemia</a>). Addison disease, also known as <a href=\"http://www.endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/addison/addison.htm\" target=\"_blank\">primary adrenal insufficiency</a>, is caused by abnormal function of the small hormone-producing glands on top of each kidney (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002219.htm\" target=\"_blank\">adrenal glands</a>). The main features of Addison disease include fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, low blood pressure, and darkening of the skin. The third major feature of triple A syndrome is alacrima. Most people with triple A syndrome have all three of these features, although some have only two.[2496][2994]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany of the features of triple A syndrome are caused by dysfunction of the <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/autonomicnervoussystemdisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">autonomic nervous system</a>. This part of the nervous system controls involuntary body processes such as digestion, blood pressure, and body temperature. People with triple A syndrome often experience abnormal sweating, difficulty regulating blood pressure, unequal pupil size (anisocoria), and other signs and symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction (dysautonomia). People with this condition may have other neurological abnormalities such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech problems (dysarthria), and a small head size (microcephaly). In addition, affected individuals commonly experience muscle weakness, movement problems, and nerve abnormalities in their extremities (peripheral neuropathy). Some develop optic atrophy, which is the degeneration (atrophy) of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain. Many of the neurological symptoms of triple A syndrome worsen over time.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 14.4px;\">Adults may exhibit&nbsp; progressive neural degenearation,&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000759.htm\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 14.4px;\">parkinsonism</a><span style=\"font-size: 14.4px;\">&nbsp;features and cognitive impairment.[2994]&nbsp;</span>People with triple A syndrome frequently develop a thickening of the outer layer of skin (hyperkeratosis) on the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet. Other skin abnormalities may also be present in people with this condition.[2496][2994]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlacrima is usually the first noticeable sign of triple A syndrome, as it becomes apparent early in life that affected children produce little or no tears while crying. Individuals typically develop Addison disease and achalasia during childhood or adolescence, and most of the neurologic features of triple A syndrome begin during adulthood. The signs and symptoms of this condition vary among affected individuals, even among members of the same family.[2496]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2015-09-24T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":2496,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Triple A syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"February 2010","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/triple-a-syndrome","dateAccessed":"2015-09-24T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":2994,"authors":"Boston BA & Marks DL","articleTitle":"Allgrove (AAA) Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"February 27, 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/919360-treatment","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":4055,"questionText":"What causes triple A syndrome?","answerText":"<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">Mutations</a>&nbsp;in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/AAAS\" target=\"_blank\">AAAS</a></em> gene cause triple A syndrome in many affected individuals. This&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a> provides instructions for making a protein called ALADIN, whose function is not well understood. Within cells, ALADIN is found in the nuclear envelope, the structure that surrounds the nucleus and separates it from the rest of the cell. Based on its location, ALADIN is thought to be involved in the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus of the cell. Mutations in the AAAS gene prevent this protein from reaching its proper location in the cell, which may disrupt the movement of molecules. Researchers suspect that DNA repair proteins may be unable to enter the nucleus if ALADIN is missing from the nuclear envelope. DNA damage that is not repaired can cause the cell to become unstable and lead to cell death. Although the nervous system is particularly vulnerable to DNA damage, it remains unknown exactly how mutations in the AAAS gene lead to the signs and symptoms of triple A syndrome.

Addison disease, also known as <a href=\"http://www.endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/addison/addison.htm\" target=\"_blank\">primary adrenal insufficiency</a>, is caused by abnormal function of the small hormone-producing glands on top of each kidney (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002219.htm\" target=\"_blank\">adrenal glands</a>). The main features of Addison disease include fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, low blood pressure, and darkening of the skin. The third major feature of triple A syndrome is alacrima. Most people with triple A syndrome have all three of these features, although some have only two.[2496][2994]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany of the features of triple A syndrome are caused by dysfunction of the <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/autonomicnervoussystemdisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">autonomic nervous system</a>.

This&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a> provides instructions for making a protein called ALADIN, whose function is not well understood. Within cells, ALADIN is found in the nuclear envelope, the structure that surrounds the nucleus and separates it from the rest of the cell. Based on its location, ALADIN is thought to be involved in the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus of the cell. Mutations in the AAAS gene prevent this protein from reaching its proper location in the cell, which may disrupt the movement of molecules. Researchers suspect that DNA repair proteins may be unable to enter the nucleus if ALADIN is missing from the nuclear envelope. DNA damage that is not repaired can cause the cell to become unstable and lead to cell death. Although the nervous system is particularly vulnerable to DNA damage, it remains unknown exactly how mutations in the AAAS gene lead to the signs and symptoms of triple A syndrome.

Another goal of treatment is to relieve the painful symptoms. Medications may be used to relieve the pain of peripheral neuropathy. Mild symptoms may be relieved by over-the-counter pain medications. For more severe symptoms,&nbsp;a doctor may recommend prescription painkillers. Anti-seizure medications were originally developed to treat epilepsy; however, some doctors also prescribe them for nerve pain.&nbsp; A cream containing capsaicin, a substance found naturally in hot peppers can cause modest improvements in peripheral neuropathy symptoms. Tricyclic antidepressant medications were originally developed to treat depression; however, they have been found to help relieve pain as well. Another type of therapy called transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) uses electrodes&nbsp;that are placed on the skin, sending a gentle electric current through the electrodes; some people report this therapy improves symptoms.

Autonomic neuropathy can cause a number of heart rate and blood pressure problems, which may be managed with medication.
