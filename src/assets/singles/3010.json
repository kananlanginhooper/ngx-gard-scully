Insulinomas, specifically, produce too much insulin, a hormone that reduces the level of sugar in the blood by helping it move into cells. As a result, people with insulinomas generally have very low blood sugar levels which can be associated with anxiety, confusion, hunger, a fast heart rate, and sweating. In severe cases, it can lead to seizures, coma or even death.[11357][11359][11360]&nbsp;Ninty percent&nbsp;of insulinomas are benign (noncancerous). In most cases, the underlying cause of insulinoma is unknown.
