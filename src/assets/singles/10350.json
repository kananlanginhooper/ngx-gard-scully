Although the condition can affect people of all ages, it generally occurs in older people (the median age of diagnosis is between 60 and 67 years). Signs and symptoms include prolonged bleeding, frequent nosebleeds, bruising throughout the body, solid swellings of congealed blood (hematomas), <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003138.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hematuria</a>, and gastrointestinal or urologic bleeding. Acquired hemophilia occurs when the body's immune system attacks and disables a certain protein that helps the blood clot. About half of the cases are associated with other conditions, such as pregnancy, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000816.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autoimmune disease</a>, cancer, skin diseases, or allergic reactions to medications.
