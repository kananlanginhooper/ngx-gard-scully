PLC is the relatively mild form of the disease <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10265/pityriasis-lichenoides\">pityriasis lichenoides</a>. A person with PLC tends to have multiple episodes of papules on the skin lasting for months or a few years, meaning the disease is chronic. The papules develop gradually. They first appear pink and scaly, and they gradually flatten and become brown in color over a period of weeks or months. Papules at various stages may be present at any one time.[2350] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cause of PLC is unknown, but it is not contagious. There are several theories about the cause of the disease, including that it may be a response by the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/immunesystem.html\">immune system</a> to an infection or medication.[2350][2228] Diagnosis of PLC is based on a doctor observing papules on the skin. A <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003840.htm\">skin biopsy</a> may be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment options may include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/antibiotics.html\">antibiotics</a>, creams for the skin, or <a href=\"https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/phototherapy/\">phototherapy</a>. In severe cases, medications that suppress the immune system response (<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/immunosuppressant-drugs\">immunosuppressants</a>) may be used.[2350][2228]<br />","dateModified":"2018-04-28T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":335,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC)?","answerText":"The signs and symptoms of pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) include the development of papules on the skin. The papules typically begin as small, firm, pink spots, and they may have a scaly layer on the top. Over time, the papules typically turn brown in color and eventually fade. This process may occur over a few weeks.[2350][2228][240]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe most common locations for the papules are the trunk, buttocks, arms, and legs. Rarely, the papules may also occur on the hands, feet, face, and scalp. The papules typically are located in groups, and are generally not painful or itchy.[2350][240] The papules can resemble those associated with <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/psoriasis.html\">psoriasis</a>, chicken pox, or insect bites.[240]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPLC is a chronic disease, meaning that some people experience the development of new papules after old papules have faded. This can last for several months to several years.[2228] PLC most commonly affects adolescents and young adults.
