It is characterized by severe delays of motor (movement) and neurological (brain) development starting in infancy. Defects in cobalamin metabolism are characterized by a buildup of methylmalonic acid and/or homocysteine in the blood and urine.[12473] There are several other types of combined&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/methylmalonic-acidemia-with-homocystinuria\" target=\"_blank\">methylmalonic acidemia and homocysteinemia</a> disorders, including <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/12128/methylmalonic-acidemia-with-homocystinuria-type-cblc\" target=\"_blank\">cblC</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/3582/methylmalonic-acidemia-with-homocystinuria-type-cbld\" target=\"_blank\">cblD</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/3584/methylmalonic-acidemia-with-homocystinuria-type-cblf\" target=\"_blank\">cblF</a> and <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/12621/methylmalonic-acidemia-with-homocystinuria-type-cblj\" target=\"_blank\">cblJ</a>.[12470] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSigns and symptoms of methylmalonic acidemia and homocysteinemia type cblX may include difficulties with weight gain (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000991.htm\" target=\"_blank\">failure to thrive</a>), <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001523.htm\" target=\"_blank\">intellectual disability</a>,&nbsp;and intractable (uncontrolled)&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003200.htm\" target=\"_blank\">epilepsy</a>. Additional features may include a very small head (microcephaly), brain malformations, and movement disorders.

In general, individuals with methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria may respond to a combined treatment strategy including supplementation of nutrients, such as a  hydroxycobalamin, betaine, folic acid, vitamin B6 and L-carnitine.[12474]</span><br />","dateModified":"2016-10-31T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":3579,"relatedDiseaseName":"Methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
