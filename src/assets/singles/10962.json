The telangiectasias develop mostly on the face, trunk and arms. The intrapulmonary shunt&nbsp;causes hypoxia (not enough oxygen supply), which slowly progresses until the person needs continuous supplemental oxygen to support their breathing.&nbsp;Blood clots and&nbsp;bleeding in the brain have also been reported in some affected individuals.
