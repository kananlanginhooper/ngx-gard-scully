Can a mother with ILVEN pass this condition to her child?","answerText":"Most often inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus (ILVEN) occurs sporadically for the first time in a family in the affected individual. It is likely&nbsp;due to a random gene mutation that occurred in the individual's skin cells while he/she&nbsp;was developing in his/her mother's womb.&nbsp;Future offspring and other family members are usually not affected, however there have been rare reports of ILVEN occurring in more than one member of the same family.[3177]&nbsp;<br><br>\r\n<p>Insuring an accurate diagnosis is important in determining your risk to future offspring. There is a rare skin condition called epidermolytic epidermal naevus,&nbsp;where a parent with epidermal nevi, has gone on to have a child with more extensive or&nbsp;generalized disease.[3179] We are not aware of a similar case report for individuals with ILVEN. Certain epidermal nevus syndromes may also be associated with an increased risk to offspring. To learn more about your specific risk to future offspring, we recommend that you&nbsp;consult with a genetics professional. Genetics clinics are a source of information for individuals and families regarding diagnosis, treatment, inheritance, and genetic risks to other family members.
