This type of cancer forms in the cells lining the small tubules in the kidney. These tubules help filter waste from the blood, making urine.&nbsp;Chromophobe RCC accounts for about 5% of all RCC cases, and it is frequently diagnosed between ages 40 and 50. It is typically diagnosed in stage I or stage II, and has an overall better prognosis than other types of RCC.

Chromophobe RCC is one of the more common types of renal tumors seen among patients with BHDS. Lipomas have been reported in patients with BHDS, albeit rarely.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDue to your husband's RCC and lung cyst, a consultation with a genetics professional may be helpful for evaluation of BHDS. During this visit, a genetic counselor or medical geneticist will likely obtain a detailed medical and cancer history, and a comprehensive family history (in particular looking for other relatives with renal cancer or the other features of BHDS). If it seems that your husband's personal medical history and family history are suggestive of BHDS, then genetic testing for diagnosis of BHDS can be discussed. Genetic professionals have training and expertise in reviewing the risks, benefits, and limitations of genetic testing, ordering the appropriate genetic test, and interpreting the results.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBHDS is caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>&nbsp;in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FLCN\" target=\"_blank\">FLCN</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a>. To date, FLCN is the only gene known to be associated with this syndrome. BHDS is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner. Some people with BHDS have an affected parent, and some have BHDS as the result of a new mutation in the FLCN gene that occurred around the time of conception (referred to as a \"<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/de-novo-mutation/\" target=\"_blank\">de novo</a>\" mutation).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGenetic testing of the FLCN gene identifies disease-causing mutations in most patients who have features consistent with BHDS. However,&nbsp;7%-9% of patients who fulfill the clinical criteria for BHDS do not have an identifiable mutation in the FLCN gene.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span>Genetics clinics are a source of information for individuals and families regarding genetic conditions, treatment, inheritance, and genetic risks to other family members.
