Most people with Swyer syndrome are raised as females. Adolescents with this condition do not go through normal puberty and are infertile. Some cases of Swyer syndrome are caused by genetic alterations (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">mutations</a>) in one of several genes, but in some cases the cause is unknown. The inheritance pattern depends on the responsible gene. This condition is diagnosed based on the chromosome results, clinical examination, and imaging studies.

I have everything else that a normal woman has but I have streaks where ovaries would be. I was diagnosed when I was 15. My doctor put me on triphasil and soon after I started showing signs of puberty. None of my doctors seem to know about this condition. I am now 31. I am wondering if I should opt to have my streaks removed and if I should be on some other form of estrogen.&nbsp;I have very little breast development.","caseQuestions":[{"questionId":6101,"questionText":"How might Swyer syndrome be treated?","answerText":"The treatment of a person with Swyer syndrome may depend on the specific characteristics that each person has.
