This may result in part of the spinal cord sticking out through an opening in the spine, leading to permanent nerve damage. Babies born with spina bifida often have a fluid-filled sac, covered by skin, on their back. This is called a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/3471/Meningocele.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">meningocele</a>.

The signs and symptoms of spina bifida can range from mild to severe, depending on the location and extent of spinal cord involvement.
