Cholestasis is a condition that impairs the release of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002237.htm\" target=\"_blank\">bile</a>&nbsp;(a digestive juice) from liver cells. The bile then builds up in the liver, impairing liver function. Symptoms typically become apparent in the third trimester of pregnancy and can include severe itching (<a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/itchy-skin/basics/definition/CON-20028460?p=1\" target=\"_blank\">pruritus</a>). Occasionally, the skin and the whites of the eyes can have a yellow appearance (<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/jaundice.html\" target=\"_blank\">jaundice</a><span>). ICP is additionally associated with risks to the developing baby such as&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pretermbirth.htm\" target=\"_blank\">premature delivery</a><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/stillbirth.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">stillbirth</a><span>. The cause of ICP is largely unknown, although approximately 15% of cases are caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>  in either the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ABCB11\" target=\"_blank\">ABCB11</a></em> or <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ABCB4\" target=\"_blank\">ABCB4</a></em> genes. Mutations within the <em>ABCB11</em> and <em>ABCB4 </em>genes are inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>  manner. Symptoms of ICP are typically limited to pregnancy. Bile flow returns to normal after delivery and the signs and symptoms of the condition disappear, however, they can return during later pregnancies.[10936][10937]</span>","dateModified":"2016-03-15T15:51:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":10299,"questionText":"What causes intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy?","answerText":"Largely, the cause of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is unknown. ICP is present in approximately 1% of pregnancies in the United States. It is thought to be caused by a mixture of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. Risk factors include:<br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\r\n    <li>A personal or family history of cholestasis of pregnancy</li>\r\n    <li>A history of liver disease</li>\r\n    <li>A multiple gestation pregnancy (twins, triplets, etc)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nApproximately 15% of women with ICP have a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a>&nbsp;in either the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ABCB11\" target=\"_blank\">ABCB11</a></em>&nbsp;or<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ABCB4\" target=\"_blank\">ABCB4</a></em>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a>.

This means that in order to be affected, a person only needs a change in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=denovomutation\" target=\"_blank\">de novo</a>) mutations within the gene.
