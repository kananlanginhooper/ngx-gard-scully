In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. As such, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one mutated copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. She can pass on the altered gene, but usually does not experience signs and symptoms of the disorder. Rarely, female carriers of a <em>ZC4H2</em> gene mutation have been reported to exhibit mild symptoms.[10499]","dateModified":"2016-01-28T16:23:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[{"referenceId":10499,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Wieacker-Wolff Syndrome; WRWF","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"OMIM","date":"6/13/2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.omim.org/entry/314580","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[{"referenceId":10497,"authors":"Annick Toutain","articleTitle":"Wieacker Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"NORD","date":"2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/wieacker-syndrome/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":10498,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Intellectual disability-developmental delay-contractures syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"orpha.net","date":"January 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?Lng=GB&Expert=3454","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
