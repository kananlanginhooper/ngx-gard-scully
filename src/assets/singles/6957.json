It is also considered less invasive, technically easier, and better suited for people with a higher surgical or <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007410.htm\" target=\"_blank\">anaesthetic</a> risk.[6062] Some researchers believe surgery is unnecessary because the disease usually does not lead to cancer. In their opinion, surgical excision should be limited to those with airway compression or severe physical deformities.[6062]\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe limitations of liposuction include incomplete removal, risk of surgical mishap, and lipomas recurrence. The main disadvantage of surgical excision is the scarring; however, it offers the chance of more extensive \"debulking\" of affected areas, and less chances that the lipoma recur.[6062][12767] However, in many cases it is not possible to remove the lipomas completely, and they often recur after both of these procedures.[6061][7904][12767]&nbsp;Also, there is no consensus about the best surgical approach. Big tumors are normally removed at various stages &ndash; it depends on the size of the tumor, coagulation problems, and impaired wound healing. In some cases, it is very difficult to prevent the bleeding during the surgery.  Liposuction is the least traumatic procedure, and therefore it is suggested as a complementary treatment.&nbsp;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful for assessment as well as preoperative planning.[12766][12767]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome researchers have reported modest success treating the condition with the medication salbutamol, which increases the breakdown of fats. Abstaining from alcohol intake, weight loss, and correction of any associated metabolic/endocrine abnormalities are also recommended.[2500][6061][6062]","dateModified":"2017-04-11T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":2500,"authors":"Alameda YA, Torres L, Perez-Mitchell C, Riera A","articleTitle":"Madelung disease: A clinical diagnosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery","date":"September 2009","volume":"141(3)","pages":"418-419","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":6061,"authors":"Ramos S, Pinheiro S, Diogo C, Cabral L, Cruzeiro C","articleTitle":"Madelung disease: a not-so-rare disorder","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Ann.
