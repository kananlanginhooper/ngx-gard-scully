Five <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/howgeneswork/protein\" target=\"_blank\">protein</a>&nbsp;complexes, named complex I through complex IV, are involved in this process. Many of the gene mutations associated with Leigh syndrome disrupt the function of proteins in these complexes, how the complexes form, or additional steps related to energy production.

Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/?id=23\" target=\"_blank\">carrier</a>. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>25% chance to be affected</li>\r\n    <li>50% chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent</li>\r\n    <li>25% chance to be unaffected&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;not  a carrier</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAutosomal recessive inheritance applies to most of the associated genes in <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/12941/nuclear-gene-encoded-leigh-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">nuclear gene-encoded Leigh syndrome</a>.[12107]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn about 20% of cases, when Leigh syndrome is due to mutations in mitochondrial DNA (<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/3671/mitochondrial-dna-associated-leigh-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome</a>), it is inherited in a <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/art/large/mitochondrial.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">mitochondrial pattern</a>.[12107] This is also called maternal inheritance. Only egg cells, but not sperm cells, pass mitochondria on to children. This means that children can inherit mtDNA mutations from their mother only. This type of Leigh syndrome can occur in every generation of a family, and can affect males and females. However, affected males do not pass the condition on to their children. The father of an affected child is not at risk of having the mtDNA mutation, but the mother of an affected child usually has the mutation and may or may not have symptoms. In some cases, an mtDNA mutation occurs for the first time in an affected person and is not inherited. This is called a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/de-novo-mutation/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>de novo</em></a>&nbsp;mutation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a few cases of Leigh syndrome due to mutations in nuclear DNA, inheritance is <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002051.htm\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked recessive</a>.[12107] X-linked recessive conditions usually occur in males, who only have one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome). Females have two X chromosomes, so if they have a gene mutation on one of them, they still have a normal copy on their other X chromosome. For this reason, females are typically unaffected.

Five <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/howgeneswork/protein\" target=\"_blank\">protein</a>&nbsp;complexes, named complex I through complex IV, are involved in this process.

Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/?id=23\" target=\"_blank\">carrier</a>. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>25% chance to be affected</li>\r\n    <li>50% chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent</li>\r\n    <li>25% chance to be unaffected&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;not  a carrier</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAutosomal recessive inheritance applies to most of the associated genes in <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/12941/nuclear-gene-encoded-leigh-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">nuclear gene-encoded Leigh syndrome</a>.[12107]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn about 20% of cases, when Leigh syndrome is due to mutations in mitochondrial DNA (<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/3671/mitochondrial-dna-associated-leigh-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome</a>), it is inherited in a <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/art/large/mitochondrial.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">mitochondrial pattern</a>.[12107] This is also called maternal inheritance. Only egg cells, but not sperm cells, pass mitochondria on to children. This means that children can inherit mtDNA mutations from their mother only. This type of Leigh syndrome can occur in every generation of a family, and can affect males and females. However, affected males do not pass the condition on to their children. The father of an affected child is not at risk of having the mtDNA mutation, but the mother of an affected child usually has the mutation and may or may not have symptoms. In some cases, an mtDNA mutation occurs for the first time in an affected person and is not inherited. This is called a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/de-novo-mutation/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>de novo</em></a>&nbsp;mutation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a few cases of Leigh syndrome due to mutations in nuclear DNA, inheritance is <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002051.htm\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked recessive</a>.[12107] X-linked recessive conditions usually occur in males, who only have one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome). Females have two X chromosomes, so if they have a gene mutation on one of them, they still have a normal copy on their other X chromosome. For this reason, females are typically unaffected.
