About half of all chordomas occur at the bottom of the spine (sacrum); about one third occur at the base of the skull. The remaining cases of chordomas form in the spine at the level of the neck, chest, or other parts of the lower back. Chordomas grow slowly, extending gradually into the surrounding bone and soft tissue. The actual symptoms depend on the location of the chordoma. A chordoma that occurs at the base of the spine may cause problems with bladder and bowel function. A chordoma at the base of the skull may lead to double vision and headaches.[13698][4526][9615]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn many cases, the cause of the chordoma remains unknown.

Duplications of the T gene have also been identified in people with chordoma who have no history of the tumor in their family, but in these cases the changes occur only in the tumor cells and are not inherited.[9615] The current treatment&nbsp;is often the surgical removal of the tumor, followed by <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/radiation-therapy/radiation-fact-sheet\" target=\"_blank\">radiotherapy</a>.[12560]</span>","dateModified":"2017-08-11T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":5473,"questionText":"How might a chordoma be treated?","answerText":"<span>Chordomas are treated with surgery because these tumors continuously grow, although they grow slowly.
