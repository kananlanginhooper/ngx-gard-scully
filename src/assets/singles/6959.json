The symptoms typically reported include: persistent sensation of motion such as rocking, swaying, and/or bobbing, difficulty maintaining balance, anxiety, fatigue, unsteadiness, and difficulty concentrating. The symptoms may be last anywhere from&nbsp;a month&nbsp;to years. Symptoms may or may not go away with time; however, they may reoccur following another motion experience or during periods of stress or illness.[870] Although there is no known cure for&nbsp;mal de debarquement syndrome, there is evidence that some patients have responded positively to antidepressants or anti-seizure medications.
