It is present from birth and usually becomes apparent in the first few days of life with respiratory failure.[12872] It sometimes is apparent before birth with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007308.htm\" target=\"_blank\">non-immune hydrops fetalis</a>&nbsp;and pleural effusion (fluid in the lung).[12872] Infants with CPL often develop severe, potentially life-threatening, respiratory distress shortly after birth.&nbsp;They&nbsp;may also develop&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003215.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cyanosis</a>&nbsp;caused by low oxygen levels in the blood, which causes the skin to have a bluish tint. Symptoms are due to abnormally wide (dilated)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002247.htm\" target=\"_blank\">lymphatic</a> vessels within the lungs.[12872][3980] These vessels drain a fluid called <a href=\"http://c.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/lymph\" target=\"_blank\">lymph</a> from different areas of the body. They are an important part of the lymphatic system, which helps the immune system protect the body against infection and disease.[3980]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe underlying cause of CPL is unknown. It&nbsp;can occur as a primary or secondary disorder (due to another underlying condition). Primary CPL occurs as an isolated defect or as part of a generalized form of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lymphaticdiseases.html\" target=\"_blank\">lymphatic disease</a> affecting the whole body. Secondary CPL can occur due to a variety of heart abnormalities or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001117.htm\" target=\"_blank\">lymphatic obstruction</a>.[3980] Some cases of CPL have been associated with genetic disorders.[3980][12872]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment aims to relieve the symptoms of the disorder and may include <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/cpap\" target=\"_blank\">CPAP</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003449.htm\" target=\"_blank\">intubation</a>, and/or fluid drainage.
