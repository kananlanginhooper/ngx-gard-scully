Most cases of MFM are caused by changes in genes that are inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002049.htm\">autosomal dominant</a>&nbsp;manner.[3155] This means that only one copy of a gene needs to be changed in order for a person to have signs and symptoms of the disease. We inherit one copy of each gene from our mother and the other one from our father.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, people with an autosomal dominant form of MFM are the first people in their family who are diagnosed with the disease. This may occur for two reasons. First, it may be that the person diagnosed with the disease is the only person in the family with a genetic change. This means that the genetic change is new (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\">de novo</a>) in the affected individual and it was not inherited from either parent. In other cases, it may be that the parents of the affected individual also have MFM, but they have a form of the disease that is slowly progressing or has not yet been diagnosed. Therefore, if a person is diagnosed with MFM and the exact genetic cause is known, it is important that their parents also receive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/testing/genetictesting\">genetic testing</a>&nbsp;to determine if one of them also has the disease.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMFM can exhibit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/inheritance/penetranceexpressivity\">reduced penetrance</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/inheritance/penetranceexpressivity\">variable expressivity</a>. Reduced penetrance means that some people who have genetic changes that cause MFM may not have signs or symptoms of the disease. However, these people can still pass on MFM to their children. Variable expressivity means that the exact symptoms of each person with MFM can differ, even within the same family. For example, some affected individuals may have both&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cardiomyopathy.html\">cardiomyopathy</a>&nbsp;and muscle weakness, while others may just have one or the other.[3155]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf MFM is caused by a change in the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FHL1\" target=\"_blank\">FHL1</a>&nbsp;</em>gene, it is inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002051.htm\">X-linked manner</a>.[3155] This means that the&nbsp;<em>FHL1</em>&nbsp;gene is located on the X chromosome. The X chromosome is one of the sex chromosomes. Each woman has two X chromosomes, and each man has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Because men have only one X chromosome, they only have one copy of the&nbsp;<em>FHL1</em>&nbsp;gene. If this gene has a mutation, they will have MFM. However, women who have changes in one copy of the&nbsp;<em>FHL1</em>&nbsp;gene are known as carriers of the disease. Most carriers do not have signs or symptoms of MFM because they have another working copy of&nbsp;<em>FHL1</em>.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf MFM is caused by a change in&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CRYAB\" target=\"_blank\">CRYAB</a>,&nbsp;</em>it is inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002052.htm\">autosomal recessive</a>&nbsp;manner.[3155] This means that both copies of the&nbsp;<em>CRYAB&nbsp;</em>gene must be changed in order to have symptoms of the disease. Men and women with a mutation in only one copy of the&nbsp;<em>CRYAB</em>&nbsp;gene are known as carriers, meaning they do not have signs or symptoms of the disease.
