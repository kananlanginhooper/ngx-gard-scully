It typically affects both feet and progresses slowly, but not indefinitely.[13279] The nodules are often painless at first, but may cause pain when walking as they grow.[1683] People with Ledderhose disease may also have other conditions associated with the formation of excess fibrous connective tissue such as <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001233.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Dupuytren contracture</a>, knuckle pads, or <a href=\"http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/peyronie/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Peyronie disease</a>. Repeated trauma, long-term alcohol consumption, chronic liver disease, diabetes, and epilepsy have also been reported in association with this condition. The exact cause of Ledderhose disease is not known, but heredity is thought to play a role in many cases.[13279] Treatment, if needed, may involve conservative management, steroid injections, radiotherapy, or surgery (<a href=\"http://www.uwmedicine.org/health-library/Pages/palmar-fasciectomy.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">fasciectomy</a>&nbsp;and removal of the fibrous tissue). The condition has a good prognosis, although slow progression is not uncommon.

Conservative management may include using soft inserts in shoes. It may help to cut holes in the inserts or inner soles to reduce pressure on the nodules.[6068] Radiation therapy may help to stop disease progression in early stages, when nodules are very small. It may also help to shrink the size of larger nodules to relieve pain.[6068] Corticosteroid injections may be beneficial in the early stages of the disease, when there is no pain or minimal pain.[13279][6068][6064] If or when steroids do not help, surgery may be needed. Surgical options include&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/fasciectomy\" target=\"_blank\">fasciectomy</a> and excision (removal) of the fibrous tissue. Fasciectomy has been shown to reduce the rate of recurrences.[13279] However, recurrence following surgery remains common.[6063]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.dupuytren-online.info/ledderhose_therapies.html\" target=\"_blank\">International Dupuytren Society</a> provides further information on treatment options for Ledderhose disease.","dateModified":"2018-07-03T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":6063,"authors":"Sheon RP, De Keyser F","articleTitle":"Ganglia and nodules","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"2013","authors2":"Basow DS","placeOfPublication":"Waltham, MA","publisher":"UpToDate"},{"referenceId":6064,"authors":"Kan HJ, Hovius SE","articleTitle":"Long-term follow-up of flaps for extensive Dupuytren's and Ledderhose disease in one family","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg","date":"2012 Dec;65(12):1741-5","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22917697","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":6068,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Therapies for Ledderhose's disease (Plantar fibromatosis or Morbus Ledderhose)","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"International Dupuytren Society","date":"2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.dupuytren-online.info/ledderhose_therapies.html","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13279,"authors":"Hougeir FG","articleTitle":"Plantar Fibromatosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"May 30, 2018","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1061903-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
