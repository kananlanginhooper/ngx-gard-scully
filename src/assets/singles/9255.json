The disorder affects newborns, usually within the first three months of life (most often within the first 10 days) in the form of epileptic seizures.&nbsp; Infants have primarily tonic seizures (which cause stiffening of muscles of the body, generally those in the back, legs, and arms), but may also experience <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000697.htm\" target=\"_blank\">partial seizures</a>, and rarely, myoclonic seizures (which cause jerks or twitches of the upper body, arms, or legs).[2510] Episodes may occur more than a hundred times per day.[12439] Most infants with the disorder show  underdevelopment of part or all of the <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brain_basics/know_your_brain.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cerebral hemispheres</a>&nbsp;or structural anomalies.[2510][12439] Some cases are caused by <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/metabolicdisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">metabolic disorders</a> or by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>  in several different <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">genes</a>.

This pattern is known as &ldquo;burst suppression.&rdquo; The seizures associated with this disease are difficult to treat and the syndrome is severely progressive.[2510] Some children with this condition go on to develop other epileptic disorders such as <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/infantilespasms/infantilespasms.htm\" target=\"_blank\">West syndrome</a> and <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lennox-gastaut-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Lennox-Gestaut syndrome</a>.[2510][12438]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2016-10-26T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":13318,"relatedDiseaseName":"Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy 12","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12901,"relatedDiseaseName":"Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 25","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12391,"relatedDiseaseName":"Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 26 ","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12900,"relatedDiseaseName":"Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 4","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12949,"relatedDiseaseName":"Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy 5","relation":"Child","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":13681,"relatedDiseaseName":"Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy-64","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":13378,"relatedDiseaseName":"GNAO1 encephalopathy","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":10933,"relatedDiseaseName":"Microcephaly, seizures, and developmental delay","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":10806,"relatedDiseaseName":"PCDH19-related female-limited epilepsy","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":13085,"relatedDiseaseName":"SCN8A encephalopathy","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
