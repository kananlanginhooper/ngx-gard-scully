The accumulation of glycogen in certain organs and tissues, especially the liver, kidneys, and small intestines, impairs their ability to function normally. Researchers have described two types of glycogen storage disease type 1, which differ in their signs and symptoms and genetic cause. These types are known as glycogen storage disease type IA and glycogen storage disease type IB.[2778] </p>\r\n<p><strong>Glycogen storage disease type 1A</strong> is characterized by growth retardation leading to <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003271.htm\" target=_blank>short stature</a> and accumulation of glycogen and fat in the liver and kidneys.&nbsp;Although some newborns present with severe <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000386.htm\" target=_blank>hypoglycemia</a>, it is more common for infants to present at age three to four months with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003275.htm\" target=_blank>hepatomegaly</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000391.htm\" target=_blank>lactic acidosis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000422.htm\" target=_blank>hyperuricemia</a>, hyperlipidemia, and/or hypoglycemic seizures.
