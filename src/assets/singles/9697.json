MMA affects the lower motor neurons. Lower motor neurons are cells that help communicate information from the brain to the muscles that are involved in movement (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/19841.htm\">skeletal muscles</a>). Specifically, monomelic amyotrophy causes weakness and loss of muscle mass in the arms and fingers. Symptoms of the disease typically begin between the ages of 14-25 years-old. The disease is most common in Asia, especially in Japan and India. Males are more likely to develop the disease than females.[14326]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe exact cause of monomelic amyotrophy is unknown. It is possible that the disease is caused by movement of the sac that surrounds the <a href=\"http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/brain,-spinal-cord,-and-nerve-disorders/biology-of-the-nervous-system/spinal-cord\">spinal cord</a> due to repeated downward movement (flexion) of the neck. Monomelic amyotrophy can sometimes run in families, but it is not thought to be caused by a specific genetic change. Diagnosis of the disease is based on <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diagnosticimaging.html\">imaging studies</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003929.htm\">electromyography (EMG)</a> consistent with the disease.

Symptoms of the disease begin between 14-25 years-old, and the symptoms typically begin in the hand or forearm of one side of the body. The muscle-wasting and weakness may progress in the affected limb over 3-9 years, but symptoms typically do not progress to the other side of the body. After a few years of worsening muscle weakness, symptoms of the disease typically stop progressing.

However, not everyone who has these genetic factors would necessarily develop MMA.
