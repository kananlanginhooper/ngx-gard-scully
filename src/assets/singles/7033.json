This leads to a build-up of toxic substances and bouts of serious illness called decompensation events or metabolic crises.[15436] Symptoms of a decompensation event include poor feeding, vomiting, trouble breathing, and lack of energy (lethargy). These can occur at different ages and can range from mild to severe. Methylmalonic acidemia is caused by changes in several different genes and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.[6311] Treatment includes aggressive management of decompensation events, a low-protein diet, certain medications, antibiotics and, in some cases, liver and kidney transplantation.
