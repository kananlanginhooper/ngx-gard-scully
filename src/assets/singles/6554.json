GBS can occur at any age, but it is especially common in people older than 50-years-old. GBS is considered to be an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/autoimmunediseases.html\">autoimmune disease</a>, meaning that it occurs when the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/immunesystem.html\">immune system</a> mistakenly attacks tissues of its own body. Specifically, the immune system of people with GBS targets the nerves of the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/8679.htm\">peripheral nervous system</a>. The peripheral nervous system is the part of the nervous system that is outside of the brain and spinal cord. It is responsible for carrying signals from the brain to the muscles of the body. When the immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system, signals cannot be sent from the brain to the muscles as quickly as they should. This causes the signs and symptoms associated with GBS.[1748]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, people who develop GBS report that they were sick with a gastrointestinal or upper respiratory illness a few days or weeks before the symptoms of GBS began. These infections can be caused by viruses such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000568.htm\">cytomegalovirus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/epstein-barr/about-ebv.html\">Epstein-Barr virus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0025750/\">flu virus,</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html\">Zika virus</a> or bacteria such as <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/index.html\"><em>Campylobacter jejuni</em></a>.[5590][10829] However, only a small number of people who have these infections develop GBS.[9859]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn very rare occasions, people have developed GBS within a few days or weeks after receiving a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/immunization.html\">vaccination</a>. For example, in 1976, there were several cases in which people developed GBS after getting the swine flu vaccine. The link between GBS and the flu vaccine in other years is unclear. It is believed that the risk of developing GBS after seasonal flu vaccines is about one in a million. Studies suggest that a person is more likely to develop GBS after having the flu than after getting a vaccine.[10829][14162] &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are also case reports that suggest a link between GBS and certain medications or surgical procedures.
