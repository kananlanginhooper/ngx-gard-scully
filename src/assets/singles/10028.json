These episodes can last from weeks to months, and the time between them, during which there are usually no symptoms, can vary from weeks to years.&nbsp;Most people with BRIC1&nbsp;have their first episode of cholestasis&nbsp;in&nbsp;their teens or twenties. Symptoms often&nbsp;present with severe itchiness, followed by yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) a few weeks later. BRIC1 is caused by mutations in the <span class=geneSymbol><em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ATP8B1\" target=_blank>ATP8B1</a></em></span> gene.

Symptoms often&nbsp;present with severe itchiness, followed by yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) a few weeks later. Other general signs and symptoms that occur during these episodes include a vague feeling of discomfort, irritability, nausea, vomiting, and a lack of appetite. A common feature of BRIC1 is the reduced absorption of fat in the body, which leads to excess fat in the feces (steatorrhea). Because of a lack of fat absorption and loss of appetite, affected individuals often lose weight during episodes of cholestasis.[5754]","dateModified":"2013-01-14T08:17:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":5754,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"MedlinePlus Genetics","date":"April 2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/benign-recurrent-intrahepatic-cholestasis","dateAccessed":"2013-01-14T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":6670,"questionText":"What causes benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis 1 (BRIC1)?","answerText":"Mutations in the <span class=geneSymbol><em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ATP8B1\" target=_blank>ATP8B1</a></em></span> gene cause BRIC1.
