Individuals with this form may develop normally until signs and symptoms begin at approximately 6 months of age. As they age,&nbsp;many of these individuals develop intellectual disability, abnormal movements and behavioral problems.

Individuals with this form may develop normally until signs and symptoms begin at approximately 6 months of age. As they age,&nbsp;many of these individuals develop intellectual disability, abnormal movements and behavioral problems. Other atypical forms of glycine encephalopathy can appear later in childhood or adulthood and cause a variety of medical problems that primarily affect the nervous system.[4587]","dateModified":"2011-10-31T10:02:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":4587,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Glycine encephalopathy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"April 2007","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/glycine-encephalopathy","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":4589,"authors":"Ada Hamosh, Gunter Scharer, Johan Van Hove","articleTitle":"Glycine Encephalopathy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"July 11, 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1357/","dateAccessed":"2015-06-09T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":1173,"questionText":"How is glycine encephalopathy inherited?","answerText":"Glycine encephalopathy&nbsp;is inherited in an <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/illustrations/autorecessive\" target=_blank>autosomal recessive</a> pattern, which means&nbsp;in an affected individual,&nbsp;both copies of the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/basics/gene\" target=_blank>gene</a> that cause this condition&nbsp;have <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\" target=_blank>mutations</a>.
