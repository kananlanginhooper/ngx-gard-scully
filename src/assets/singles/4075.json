The most common affected areas are the palms of the hand, the soles of the feet, and the area around the eyes and mouth. Other symptoms include sparse hair and abnormal nails, joint abnormalities, pain, and itching. The abnormal skin thickening in Olmsted syndrome tends to get worse over time. People with this condition are at increased risk for infections and for skin cancer.&nbsp;Olmsted syndrome is caused by genetic changes (<a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/776887\" target=\"_blank\">DNA variants</a>) in the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TRPV3\" target=\"_blank\">TRPV3</a></em>&nbsp;and the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MBTPS2\" target=\"_blank\">MBTPS2</a>&nbsp; </em>gene. Many different forms of inheritance have been reported, although many cases of Olmsted syndrome are sporadic (a new case in a family). Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, and genetic testing can be helpful. Treatment includes oral and topical retinoids and steroids. Newer medications used to treat cancer are under investigation.[15518][15519][15520]","dateModified":"2020-05-01T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13414,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Olmsted syndrome?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with Olmsted syndrome.
