Ivemark syndrome is classified as a <a href=\"http://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/heterotaxy-syndrome-isomerism/about#.VsySAPkrJhE\" target=\"_blank\">heterotaxy</a> disorder or a laterality disorder. These terms refer to the failure of the internal organs of the chest and abdomen to be arranged in the proper location within the body. It is characterized by the absence (asplenia) or underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/spleendiseases.html\" target=\"_blank\">spleen</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/CongenitalHeartDefects/AboutCongenitalHeartDefects/Common-Types-of-Heart-Defects_UCM_307017_Article.jsp#.VsyW7_krJhE\" target=\"_blank\">heart malformations</a>, and the abnormal arrangement of the internal organs of the chest and abdomen. Symptoms vary greatly depending on the specific abnormalities present; however if heart malformations are complex, the prognosis is often poor. The exact cause of Ivemark syndrome is not known. Most cases are sporadic (isolated and seemingly random). Unlike some other heterotaxy disorders, causative <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a>  <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>  have not been identified. There is no cure for Ivemark syndrome. Treatment might include surgical repair of heart malformations when appropriate and prophylactic antibiotic therapy to reduce the incidence of infection due to&nbsp;the absence or poor function of the spleen.[4387][10708][10710]</p>","dateModified":"2016-02-23T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":10875,"relatedDiseaseName":"Heterotaxy","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
