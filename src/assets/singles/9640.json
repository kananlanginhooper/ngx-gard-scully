People affected by this condition generally begin developing frequent and recurrent bacterial infections from about 6 months of age. Commonly diagnosed infections include lung infections (pneumonia and bronchitis), middle ear infections, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001010.htm\" target=\"_blank\">conjunctivitis</a>, sinus infections, various skin infections, and infections that are associated with chronic diarrhea.[11268][11269][11270] Agammaglobulinemia, non-Bruton type can be caused by changes (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>) in many different genes, including <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IGHM\" target=\"_blank\">IGHM</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IGLL1\" target=\"_blank\">IGLL1</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CD79A\" target=\"_blank\">CD79A</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CD79B\" target=\"_blank\">CD79B</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/BLNK\" target=\"_blank\">BLNK</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PIK3R1\" target=\"_blank\">PIK3R1</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TCF3#\" target=\"_blank\">TCF3</a></em>.
