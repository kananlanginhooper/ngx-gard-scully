Seizures are common and frequently precede other symptoms. About half of people with this diagnosis exhibit a specific type of seizure called faciobrachial dystonic seizures, which resemble brief jerks of the face arm.[14204][14206][14207][14208][14209][14210] <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000394.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Hyponatremia</a>&nbsp;(low levels of sodium in the blood) may also be present.[14204][14207][14210] The disease occurs when antibodies mistakenly attack LGI1 (leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1), a protein found in the brain that binds together two epilepsy-related proteins called ADAM22 and ADAM23.[14204][14209][14210] Some people with limbic encephalitis with LGI1 antibodies (5 to 10%) also have a cancer diagnosis (most commonly <a href=\"https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/thymoma?sectionTitle=Overview\" target=\"_blank\">thymoma</a> and lung cancer), but most do not.[14204][14210]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe disease is diagnosed through testing of blood or spinal fluid for LGI1 antibodies.[14204][14207][14209] If treatment is started when seizures are first noticed, limbic encephalitis may be prevented.[14204][14206] Treatment is intravenous or oral corticosteroids, <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/immunoglobulin-therapy#1\" target=\"_blank\">intravenous immunoglobulin</a> (IVIG), <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/transplant/programs/kidney/incompatible/plasmapheresis.html\" target=\"_blank\">plasmapheresis</a> (a process where antibodies are removed from the blood), or a combination of these.[14204][14207][14209][14210] Long-term outcome is mostly favorable, although some people are left with some degree of residual impairment.
