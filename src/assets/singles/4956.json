All affected individuals whose parents have been evaluated with molecular genetic testing have had one parent with an ATXN8OS repeat expansion.&nbsp;Expansions appearing for the first time in an affected individual&nbsp;(called a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/de-novo-mutation/\" target=_blank>de novo mutation</a>) have not been reported.[4845] These findings support the notion that SCA8 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.<br><br>When genetic testing of unaffected parent is not possible, individuals may not be able to determine from which parent the unstable gene was transmitted. However, genetic testing of other family members (such as aunts, uncles or cousins) may help to determine whether the gene was transmitted from an affected individual's mother or father. It has been observed that CTG repeats almost always expand when transmitted by the mother. In individuals with no apparent family history of SCA8, it is common for the mother to be asymptomatic and to have&nbsp;the repeat expansion with a shorter repeat length than her affected child. When the gene is transmitted by the father, the CTG repeats almost always contract in length, usually to a range that is less often associated with developing the disease.[4845] Another unusual feature of the SCA8 gene is that&nbsp;when the number of CTG expansions becomes too large, the gene no longer appears to cause disease. This means that an unaffected father may have a gene with a very large expansion, and it may once again contract when he passes it on to his children, causing the disease to appear in them.[4844]<br><br>It is recommended that individuals with specific questions about the inheritance of SCA8 and/or genetic testing for SCA8 speak with a genetics professional.","dateModified":"2012-01-02T12:22:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[{"referenceId":4844,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 8 (SCA8)","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Ataxia Foundation","date":"","url":"http://www.ataxia.org/pdf/NAF%20Web%20Content%20Publication%20SCA8.pdf","dateAccessed":"2011-01-02T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":4845,"authors":"Yoshio Ikeda, Joline C Dalton, John W Day, Laura PW Ranum","articleTitle":"Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 8","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"February 7, 2007","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1268/","dateAccessed":"2011-01-02T00:00:00"}]},{"questionId":2567,"questionText":"How can I find a genetics professional in my area?","answerText":"To find a medical professional who specializes in genetics, you can ask your doctor for a referral or you can search for one yourself.
