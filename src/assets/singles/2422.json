The diagnosis can be confirmed with biochemical and molecular genetic testing.[14968][14975] The treatment is dietary therapy, which involves taking calcium supplements and restricting galactose in the diet throughout life to prevent cataracts.[14977] If cataracts develop, they usually resolve with dietary therapy.[14968][14975] Children with GALK should have their growth monitored, and both children and adults should consult with a dietitian and have regular eye exams.[14977]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2018-10-09T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":2424,"relatedDiseaseName":"Galactosemia","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
