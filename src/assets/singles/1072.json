In some cases, the skull and hip bones are also affected. The thickened bones can lead to pain in the arms and legs, a waddling walk, muscle weakness, and extreme tiredness. An increase in the density of the skull results in increased pressure on the brain and can cause a variety of neurological problems, including headaches, hearing loss, vision problems, dizziness (vertigo), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), and facial paralysis. The added pressure that thickened bones put on the muscular and skeletal systems can cause abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), joint deformities (contractures), knock knees, and flat feet (pes planus). Other features of Camurati-Engelmann disease include abnormally long limbs in proportion to height, a decrease in muscle mass and body fat, and delayed puberty.[376][377] In the most severe cases, the mandibula (jaw), vertebrae, thoracic cage, shoulder girdle, and carpal (hands, wrist) and tarsal (foot, ankle) bones are involved.[379]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRadiographically (on X-ray), the shafts of long bones show symmetric and progressive widening and malformation (diaphyseal dysplasia).

The <em>TGFB1</em> gene provides instructions for producing a protein called transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF&beta;-1). The TGF&beta;-1 protein helps control the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (motility), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). The TGF&beta;-1 protein is found throughout the body and plays a role in development before birth, the formation of blood vessels, the regulation of muscle tissue and body fat development, wound healing, and immune system function. TGF&beta;-1 is particularly abundant in tissues that make up the skeleton, where it helps regulate bone growth, and in the intricate lattice that forms in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix).[376]</p>\r\n<p>Within cells, the TGF&beta;-1 protein is turned off (inactive) until it receives a chemical signal to become active.

NSAIDs and bisphosphonates have not been proven to be effective for most people with CED. Corticosteroids may relieve some of the symptoms such as pain and weakness, and can also improve gait and exercise tolerance. However, they have serious side effects with long-term use.[377][380][10930][10931][10932]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore recently, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a695008.html\" target=\"_blank\">losartan</a>, an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/angiotensin-ii-receptor-blockers/art-20045009\" target=\"_blank\">angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist</a>, has been reported to reduce limb pain and increase muscle strength in multiple case reports.[10931][10932] However, the use of losartan needs more study to determine if it is effective and safe for those with CED. Exercise programs, when tolerated, have also been found to be beneficial.[10931][10932]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSurgical procedures may also be needed in people with CES. Craniectomy, which involves removing a portion of the skull to relieve pressure on the brain, may be needed to reduce intracranial pressure and relieve symptoms in some people. Myringotomy, a procedure used to relieve pressure within the middle ear, may improve conductive hearing loss from fluid build-up in the ear.[380]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOngoing surveillance by various specialists may be needed to monitor signs and symptoms and make sure medical therapies remain safe to use. Depending on each person's symptoms and treatment, a person with CES may need periodic blood pressure checks, blood tests, neurologic exams, hearing evaluations, eye exams, bone density scans, or other types of surveillance. Children with CES should have routine growth monitoring, and those with cranial involvement (including those treated surgically) should continue to be monitored for signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure.[380]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease note: Case reports detail the signs and symptoms in individual cases.
