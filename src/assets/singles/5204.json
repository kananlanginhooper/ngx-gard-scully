TDC is the most common congenital midline neck mass in the pediatric population.[11521] They usually present in children, around 6 years of age, but rarely, they may present in adulthood.[11522] They present as a painless, palpable mass  that develops around the midline and moves with swallowing. Other symptoms might include: fluctuation in size of mass, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/swallowingdisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">dysphagia</a>, infection of mass, and mid-neck tenderness.[11521] TDCs are caused by abnormal development of the <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/thyroiddiseases.html\" target=\"_blank\">thyroid gland</a> in fetal development.[11522] The cause of this abnormal development is largely not known and usually sporadic; however, in rare circumstances TDCs can be inherited. Familial TDC are commonly inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>  pattern with rare reports of <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>  inheritance.[11523][11524] Treatment involves surgery to remove the cyst (mass).[11521]","dateModified":"2016-05-17T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":843,"questionText":"What causes familial thyroglossal duct cysts?","answerText":"Thyroglossal duct cysts (TDCs) are caused by abnormal development and migration of the cells forming the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/thyroiddiseases.html\" target=\"_blank\">thyroid gland</a> between the 4th and 8th week of fetal development. The thyroglossal duct is the area in which the cells that form the thyroid gland migrate during fetal development. It typically closes off and dissolves before birth, but may remain open in some individuals. When the thyroglossal duct fails to dissolve completely, a cyst (fluid filled sac) may form. It is not clear why occurs in some individuals. While most cases are sporadic; there are reports of at least six families in which TDC appear to be hereditary.
