Phosphate levels are low because phosphate is abnormally processed in the kidneys, which causes a loss of phosphate in the urine (phosphate wasting) and leads to soft, weak bones  (<a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rickets/basics/definition/con-20027091\" target=\"_blank\">rickets</a>). XLH is usually diagnosed in childhood. Features include bowed or bent legs, short stature, bone pain, and severe dental pain.[10809][10808] XLH is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PHEX\" target=\"_blank\">PHEX&nbsp;</a></em>gene on the <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=208\" target=\"_blank\">X chromosome</a>, and inheritance is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genetics.edu.au/Publications-and-Resources/Genetics-Fact-Sheets/FactSheet10A\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked dominant</a>.
