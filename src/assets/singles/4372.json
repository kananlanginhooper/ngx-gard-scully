Specific symptoms present and their severity can vary from person to person. Early symptoms, which often become apparent in the first year of life, may include very low muscle tone (hypotonia) and significant developmental delays. Some infants have a small head size (microcephaly). Children may learn to walk months or years later than expected, and some children never acquire the skills to walk independently. Speech is significantly delayed, and while some children learn to say a few words, most do not speak. However, some are able to understand and follow simple directions. Intellectual disability generally ranges from moderate to severe.[10335][10334][14718]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdditional signs and symptoms of PTHS may include:[10335][10334][14718][14719]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Behavioral differences: Symptoms of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/autismspectrumdisorder.html\" target=\"_blank\">autism spectrum disorder</a>&nbsp;may be present.

However, many children with PTHS are described as having happy dispositions.</li>\r\n    <li>Distinctive facial features: These may become more obvious with age and may include deeply-set eyes, a prominent nose, short&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/9012.htm\" target=\"_blank\">philtrum</a>, wide mouth, full lower lip, widely-spaced teeth, and/or a prominent chin.</li>\r\n    <li>Breathing problems: These may include episodes of rapid breathing (episodic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003071.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hyperventilation</a>) followed by episodes of struggling to breath or not breathing. Episodes of breathing problems may be triggered by anxiety, excitement, or tiredness. Failure to breathe may cause a bluish discoloration of the skin (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003215.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cyanosis</a>) or fainting.</li>\r\n    <li>Seizures: These occur in almost half of people with PTHS, and the type and severity varies.
