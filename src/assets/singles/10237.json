The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary from person to person, even within the same family. Without early diagnosis and treatment, most affected people develop features of the condition between ages 3 and 10 years. Signs and symptoms may include recurrent episodes of confusion, seizures, ataxia (problems coordinating movements), <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/dystonia.html\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">dystonia</a>, facial palsy (weakness of the facial muscles), external ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of the muscles surrounding the eye), and <a href=\"http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/Pages/dysph.aspx\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">dysphagia</a>. Eventually, these episodes can lead to coma or even death.
