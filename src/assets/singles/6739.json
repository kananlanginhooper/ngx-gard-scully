The right side of the heart then pumps blood to the lungs and the body. Therefore, there may be no symptoms for a few days. However, when these openings close, oxygen-rich blood cannot easily get to the rest of the body. Symptoms then develop quickly, and may include problems breathing, pounding heart, weak pulse, and/or an ashen or bluish skin color.

Most pediatric cardiologists and surgeons in the US recommend staged surgery, and there is debate among experts about whether comfort care should be offered as an option at all. Improvements in medical and surgical care have improved outcomes for children with HLHS significantly.[13773] However, babies that are treated with surgery are not guaranteed to survive. While some doctors consider heart transplantation an alternative to the 3 step surgery, there are few donated hearts available for small infants.[3960]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInitial management focuses on helping the baby breathe and keeping the ductus arteriosis open so blood circulates through the body (with prostaglandin E1).
