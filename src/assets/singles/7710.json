People with this condition cannot break down the sugars sucrose (a sugar found in fruits, and also known as table sugar) and maltose (the sugar found in grains). CSID usually becomes apparent after an infant begins to consume fruits, juices, and grains. After ingestion of sucrose or maltose, an affected child will typically experience stomach cramps, bloating, excess gas production, and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003126.htm\" target=_blank>diarrhea</a>. These digestive problems can lead to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000991.htm\" target=_blank>failure to thrive</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000404.htm\" target=_blank>malnutrition</a>. Most affected children are better able to tolerate sucrose and maltose as they get older. CSID is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=_blank>autosomal recessive</a> pattern and is caused by mutations in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SI\" target=_blank><em>SI</em></a> gene.[3482]","dateModified":"2011-05-17T13:06:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":4521,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID)?","answerText":"Affected infants usually develop symptoms soon after they first ingest sucrose, which is found in modified milk formulas, fruits, or starches.
