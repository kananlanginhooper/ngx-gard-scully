Most affected individuals do not speak, or speak only a few words. They may have temper tantrums, bite themselves, or exhibit other behavior problems. Most have structural abnormalities of the brain, and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003200.htm\">seizures</a> occur in more than half of individuals with this disorder. Affected individuals usually have weak muscle tone (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003298.htm\">hypotonia</a>) and swallowing difficulties (<a href=\"http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/dysph.htm#1\">dysphagia</a>). Other features include&nbsp;a&nbsp;small head that is unusually short and wide; vision and hearing problems; abnormalities of the skeleton, heart, gastrointestinal system, kidneys, or genitalia; and distinctive facial features. 1p36 deletion syndrome is caused by a <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=45\" target=\"_blank\">deletion</a>  of genetic material from a specific region in the short (p) arm of <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/1#ideogram\" target=\"_blank\">chromosome 1</a>. Most cases are not inherited; only about 20% of the cases of people with 1p36 deletion syndrome inherit the chromosome with a deleted segment from an unaffected parent. In these cases, the parent carries a balanced <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=201\" target=\"_blank\">translocation</a>, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. [3705] There is no cure for this syndrome. Treatment depends on the symptoms, and may include rehabilitation/educational programs, antiepileptic medication, and standard treatment for heart, kidney, eye, hearing or bone problems.[11279]","dateModified":"2016-04-18T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6683,"questionText":"What is the life expectancy for individuals with chromosome 1p36 deletion syndrome?","answerText":"The severity and nature of signs and symptoms of chromosome 1p36 deletion syndrome varies between affected individuals, so it is difficult to predict the long-term outlook for an individual child.[5772][5773] Generally, affected individuals do survive well into adult life.[5772] There has been one study to date in which the course of 1p36 deletion syndrome was investigated, with a follow-up spanning 18 years.
