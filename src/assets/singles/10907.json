In XMEN, the number of T cells, a type of immune cell, are decreased or don&rsquo;t work right. Because there are not enough T cells, males with XMEN may have more frequent infections. In addition, they are more likely to get sick from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a common virus found in most people. Typically, only people with immune systems that don&rsquo;t&rsquo; work well can develop symptoms from an EBV infection. In males with XMEN, EBV infections lead to abnormal growth of lymph cells and cancer of the lymph system (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lymphoma.html\" target=\"_blank\">l</a><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lymphoma.html\" target=\"_blank\">ymphoma</a>).[15182]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nXMEN is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MAGT1\" target=\"_blank\">MAGT1</a></em> gene, that controls how magnesium gets in and out of the body&rsquo;s cells.[15185] It is inherited in an X-linked pattern in families. XMEN is diagnosed based on the symptoms, and genetic testing for <em>MAGT1</em> mutations can also be helpful.[15183][15184] Treatment for XMEN may include magnesium supplements, chemotherapy for lymphoma, and possible stem cell transplant.[15183][15184]  Because XMEN has only been diagnosed in a few patients, the long-term outlook for males with XMEN is unknown.[15183]","dateModified":"2019-01-09T12:45:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13122,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of X-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium deficiency, Epstein-Barr virus infection and neoplasia (XMEN)?","answerText":"The symptoms of X-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium deficiency, Epstein-Barr virus infection and neoplasia (XMEN) vary from patient to patient and have appeared from ages 3-45 years.[15183] In childhood, some males with XMEN have frequent sinus, ear and lung infections, enlarged spleens and a weakened response to some vaccines. By adulthood, males with XMEN develop excessive growth of lymph cells (<a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/lymphoproliferative-disorder\" target=\"_blank\">lymphoproliferative disease</a>), and may develop cancer of the lymph system (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lymphoma.html\" target=\"_blank\">lymphoma</a>).[15183]  Laboratory findings of males with XMEN include increased levels of Epstein Barr virus (EBV) in the blood, low levels of one type of immune cell (CD4 cells), and increased levels of EBV-infected immune cells (B cells).

Therefore, X-linked immunodeficiency deficiency with magnesium deficiency, Epstein-Barr virus infection and neoplasia (XMEN) is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern.[15182] In males (who have only one X chromosome), one mutated copy of the <em>MAGT1 </em>gene in each cell is enough to cause XMEN. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation needs to occur in both copies of the <em>MAGT1</em> gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two mutated copies of this gene, XMEN, like other X-linked recessive disorders, affects males much more frequently than females. Females who have a mutation in one copy of the <em>MAGT1</em> gene are called carriers. Most carriers of X-linked disorders have no signs or symptoms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA female who carries one <em>MAGT1</em> gene mutation has a 50% or 1 in 2 chance of having a son with XMEN.
