In some people, the disease also results in arthritis (swollen, painful, stiff joints), skin problems, and inflammation of the digestive tract, brain, and spinal cord.[1603][1604][1605]&nbsp;Although it can happen at any age, symptoms generally&nbsp;begin when individuals are in their 20s or 30s.&nbsp;The disease is common in Japan, Turkey and Israel, and less common in the United States.[1604] The exact&nbsp;cause of Beh&ccedil;et disease is still unknown, but it is thought that it is an autoimmune disease, where the abnormal immune activity is triggered by exposure to an environmental agent (such as an infection) in people with a genetic predisposition to develop the disease. Research show that people with Beh&ccedil;et&rsquo;s disease, especially those of Middle Eastern and Asian descent, have an increased frequency of certain &ldquo;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genefamily/hla\" target=\"_blank\">human leukocyte antigens</a>&rdquo; (HLAs), specifically HLA-B51, than the general population, which may increase the risk (predispose) to have the disease.[1603][1604][1605]&nbsp; <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment is symptomatic and supportive.

It tends to occur more often in men than in women. </span>Beh&ccedil;et disease is a multi-system disease and it may involve all organs of the body. Signs and symptoms may include:[1603][1604]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Sores inside the mouth or genitals</strong>: The earliest symptom of Beh&ccedil;et disease is usually painful canker round or oval sores with reddish borders on the mucous membranes that line the mouth (aphthous stomatitis) or in the skin of the genitalia. They may be shallow or deep and may be single or multiple lesions that typically heal within a few days, up to a week or more, without scarring, but frequently recur. &nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Eye problems:</strong> Symptoms may include inflammation of the back of the eye (posterior uveitis); inflammation of the anterior chamber (anterior uveitis or iridocyclitis); inflammation of the iris accompanied by pain, tearing (lacrimation); and accumulation of pus (hypopyon iritis). The retina may become inflamed resulting in blurred vision, abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia), and/or inflammation of the thin membranous layer of blood vessels behind the retina (chorioretinitis). Repeated recurrences may result in the partial loss of vision (decreased visual acuity) or complete blindness if the disease is uncontrolled. In some cases, eye abnormalities may be the first symptom of Beh&ccedil;et disease or they may not develop until several years after the sores of the mouth.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Pus-filled lesions and other problems on the skin</strong>: Some affected individuals, especially females, may develop lesions that resemble those of erythema nodosum, a skin disorder characterized by the formation of tender, reddish, inflammatory nodules on the front of the legs. These nodules disappear on their own (spontaneously) sometimes leaving faint scars or discoloration (pigmentation). Some people with Beh&ccedil;et disease may develop small eruptions that resemble acne (acneiform eruptions) and/or inflammation that mistakenly appear to affect the hair follicles on the skin (pseudofolliculitis).</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Pain in the joints</strong> (50% of cases)<strong>:</strong> Affected individuals have pain (arthralgia) and swelling in various joints (knees, wrists, elbows and ankles), before, during, or after the onset of the other symptoms.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Recurring ulcers in the digestive tract:</strong> Symptoms vary from mild abdominal discomfort to severe inflammation of the large intestine and rectum accompanied by diarrhea or bleeding.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Problems of the central nervous system</strong> (10%-20% of the cases)<strong>:</strong> These symptoms usually appear months or years after the initial symptoms of Beh&ccedil;et disease. Recurring attacks of inflammation involving the brain (parenchymal Neuro-Beh&ccedil;et) or the membranes that surround the brain or spinal cord (<a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/children/understanding-meningitis-basics#1\" target=\"_blank\">meningitis</a>) can result in neurological damage. Symptoms may include headache, cranial nerve palsies, the inability to coordinate voluntary movement (cerebellar ataxia), impaired muscle movements of the face and throat, stroke, memory loss and/or, rarely, seizures.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis):</strong> Involvement of small vessels is thought to drive many of the problems that the disorder causes. In some instances inflammation of the large veins, particularly those in the legs may occur along with the formation of blood clots (thrombophlebitis). The walls of an involved artery may bulge forming a sac (aneurysm). In very rare cases, blood clots from the veins travel to the lungs (pulmonary emboli) resulting in episodes of chest pain, coughing, difficult or labored breathing (dyspnea), and coughing up blood (hemoptysis).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIt is especially important to identify Beh&ccedil;et disease when there is ocular, central nervous system or large blood vessel involvement because these as manifestations are usually the most serious.[1603]","dateModified":"2018-05-03T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":1603,"authors":"Calamia KT","articleTitle":"Behcet's Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)","date":"2018","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.rarediseases.org/rare-disease-information/rare-diseases/byID/100/viewAbstract","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":1604,"authors":"","articleTitle":"NINDS Behcet's Disease Information Page","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)","date":"2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Behcets-Disease-Information-Page","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":2533,"questionText":"What causes Beh&ccedil;et disease?","answerText":"The exact cause of Beh&ccedil;et disease is unknown. Most symptoms of the disease are caused by inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis). Inflammation is a characteristic reaction of the body to injury or disease and is marked by four signs: swelling, redness, heat, and pain. Doctors think that an autoimmune reaction may cause the blood vessels to become inflamed, but they do not know what triggers this reaction. Under normal conditions, the immune system protects the body from diseases and infections by killing harmful \"foreign\" substances, such as germs, that enter the body. In an autoimmune reaction, the immune system mistakenly attacks and harms the body's own tissues. Beh&ccedil;et disease is not contagious; it does not spread from one person to another.[1605]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nResearchers think that two factors are important for a person to develop Beh&ccedil;et disease:[1605][14592]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>First, it is believed that abnormalities of the immune system make some people susceptible to the disease. Scientists think that this susceptibility may be inherited; that is, it may be due to one or more specific genes.&nbsp; People with the disease are more likaly to have certain &ldquo;human leukocyte antigens&rdquo; (HLAs) in the blood, especially HLA-B51, than the general population. Other genetic markers and their role in the development of Beh&ccedil;et&rsquo;s disease are being studied.</li>\r\n    <li>Second, something in the environment, possibly a bacterium (such as Helicobacter pylori) or virus (such as Herpes simplex virus, and parvovirus B19) or exposition to certain substances (such as heavy metals), might trigger or activate the disease in susceptible people.</li>\r\n</ul>","dateModified":"2018-05-03T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":1605,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Questions and Answers about Behçet’s Disease","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)","date":"2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Behcets_Disease/default.asp","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14592,"authors":"Smith EL, &  Yazici Y","articleTitle":"Pathogenesis of Behçet syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"January 17, 2018","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-behcet-syndrome","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":2535,"questionText":"How&nbsp;might Beh&ccedil;et disease be treated?","answerText":"Although there is no cure for Beh&ccedil;et disease, people can usually&nbsp;control symptoms with proper medication, rest, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle.
