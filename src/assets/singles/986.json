The bones of the ring finger are typically normal. Other abnormalities may also be present such as hypersegmentation (extra bones) of the index and middle fingers; ulnar deviation (angled towards the fifth finger) of the index finger; and unusually-shaped bones and/or epiphysis (end of a long bone).
