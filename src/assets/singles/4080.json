In males, the penis is either flat and short or sometimes split. In females, the clitoris is split and there may be two vaginal openings. Also, frequently the intestine is short and the anus is not open (anus imperforate). There is a high association with other birth defects, especially spina bifida, which occurs in up to 75% of cases. Omphalocele, a defect of the abdominal wall in the region of the umbilicus, is also common, as are kidney abnormalities.[10880] The defect occurs when the baby is developing inside the uterus during the first trimester of pregnancy, and seems to be due to the rupture of a tissue known as the cloacal membrane which results in the abnormal development of the abdominal wall and other malformations. The timing of the rupture determines the severity of the disorder. The cause for this malformation is unknown. Treatment involves surgical repair of each malformation.[10883]","dateModified":"2016-03-09T23:09:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":2207,"relatedDiseaseName":"Exstrophy-epispadias complex","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
