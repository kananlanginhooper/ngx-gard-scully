A VIPoma secretes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003508.htm\" target=\"_blank\">vasoactive intestinal peptide</a> (VIP), a hormone that&nbsp;stimulates the secretion (and inhibits the absorption) of sodium, chloride, potassium and water within the small intestine.[14851] Excessive secretion can increase bowel motility and lead to signs and symptoms such as abdominal pain and cramping, severe watery diarrhea, dehydration, flushing of the face, muscle cramps due to low potassium levels (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000479.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypokalemia</a>), and weight loss.[14851][2109] When a person has a VIPoma and these associated symptoms, it is referred to as VIPoma syndrome, also called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/3787/wdha-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">WDHA syndrome</a>&nbsp;or Verner-Morrison syndrome.[14851] The majority of people with a VIPoma have VIPoma syndrome.[14852]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVIPomas are usually diagnosed in middle-aged adults or in young children.[14852] Tests used to diagnose a VIPoma may include blood tests (including VIP level), imaging studies such as a CT scan or MRI, and examination of a stool sample.[2109] Unfortunately, even though these tumors are slow-growing, the majority of VIPomas are <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/metastatic\" target=\"_blank\">metastatic</a>&nbsp;(have spread to other parts of the body) at the time of diagnosis.[14851][14852] The underlying cause of VIPomas is not yet known.[2109]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nManagement typically first involves treating dehydration with fluids and correcting the imbalance of hormones and other substances (metabolic abnormalities) in the body. Medications such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a693049.html\" target=\"_blank\">octreotide</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a615007.html\" target=\"_blank\">lanreotide</a> can usually stop the diarrhea and inhibit the secretion of VIP.[14851][14852] Surgery typically follows in order to remove the tumor. When there is no evidence of metastasis, complete removal of the tumor is the only possible cure.[14851] The majority of metastatic cases will not be cured by surgery, but symptoms may be managed and prolonged survival is often possible due to the slow-growing nature of these tumors. <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/targeted-therapy\" target=\"_blank\">Targeted therapy</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/chemotherapy\" target=\"_blank\">chemotherapy</a> may also be used for people with progressive, advanced disease. The <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/median-survival\" target=\"_blank\">median survival</a> of people with VIPomas is 96 months, but long-term survival mainly depends on the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/tumor-grade\" target=\"_blank\">tumor grade</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/staging\" target=\"_blank\">staging</a>, and whether all or most of the tumor can be removed.[14852]","dateModified":"2018-08-02T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":3787,"relatedDiseaseName":"WDHA syndrome","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
