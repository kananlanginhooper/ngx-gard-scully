Congenital rubella occurs when the rubella virus in the mother affects the developing baby in the first 3 months of pregnancy. After the fourth month, if the mother has a rubella infection, it is less likely to harm the developing baby.[13815] The most common problems are hearing loss due to damage to the nerve pathways from the inner ear to the brain (<a href=\"http://www.asha.org/public/hearing/Sensorineural-Hearing-Loss/\">sensorineural hearing loss</a>), ocular abnormalities (<a href=\"https://nei.nih.gov/health/cataract/cataract_facts\">cataract</a>, infantile <a href=\"https://nei.nih.gov/health/glaucoma/glaucoma_facts\">glaucoma</a>, and <a href=\"http://disorders.eyes.arizona.edu/category/clinical-features/pigmentary-retinopathy\">pigmentary retinopathy</a>) and heart problems.
