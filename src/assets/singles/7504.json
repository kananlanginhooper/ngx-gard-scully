Bone marrow contains <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/stemcells.html\" target=\"_blank\">stem cells</a> which develop into the red blood cells that carry oxygen through the body, the white blood cells that fight infections, and the platelets that help with blood clotting. In people with PRCA, the bone marrow makes a reduced number of red blood cells (called <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000560.htm\" target=\"_blank\">anemia</a>). As a result, affected people may experience fatigue, lethargy, and pale skin.[11313][11314] PRCA has many different causes. A rare congenital form of PRCA, called <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/6274/blackfan-diamond-syndrome/Resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">Diamond Blackfan syndrome</a>, is an inherited condition that is also associated with other physical abnormalities. PRCA can also be due to certain medications, infections, pregnancy, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/kidneyfailure.html\" target=\"_blank\">renal failure</a>, and conditions such as <a href=\"http://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/thymoma/overview\" target=\"_blank\">thymomas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000816.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autoimmune disease</a> (such as <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10253/lupus/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">systemic lupus erythematosus</a>), cancers of the blood, and solid tumors. In many cases, the cause of the condition is unknown (idiopathic).[11313][11315] The treatment of PRCA aims to address the underlying cause of the condition and relieve the associated signs and symptoms.[11313]","dateModified":"2016-04-21T15:35:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
