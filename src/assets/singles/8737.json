Symptoms often begin between adolescence and young adulthood and develop over weeks to months. People with IH have a hard time staying awake and alert during the day (chronic excessive daytime sleepiness, or EDS). They may fall asleep unintentionally or at inappropriate times, interfering with daily functioning. They may also have difficulty waking up from nighttime sleep or daytime naps. Sleeping longer at night does not appear to improve daytime sleepiness.[12999] IH is a chronic disorder. Symptoms may remain generally stable over time, or severity may fluctuate over time.[12999][14722]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cause of IH is not known.
