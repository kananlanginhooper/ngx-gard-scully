HUV causes recurrent episodes of hives (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hives.html\">urticaria</a>) and painful skin lesions that itch or burn.[1491] Individuals with HUV may also have systemic, multiorgan involvement, causing arthritic joint pain; pulmonary (lung) disease; ocular (eye) inflammation; kidney inflammation; or various other symptoms.[1493][12566][13034]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome scientists refer to the condition as HUV syndrome (HUVS) when it is more severe and there is significant systemic involvement.[13034][13035] Other scientists call the condition HUVS in the <em>absence</em> of systemic disease.[12567] In some cases, the terms are used as synonyms.[12567] There appears to be controversy regarding the nomenclature and classification of HUV and HUVS, and whether they are distinct conditions or represent a continuum of the same disease.[12567]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoth genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role in causing HUV.

In some cases HUV may be associated with an underlying infection or systemic diseases such as systemic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10253/lupus\" target=\"_blank\">lupus</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10252/sjogren-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome</a>,  <a href=\"https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=134&amp;ContentID=121\" target=\"_blank\">monoclonal gammopathy</a>, or blood disorders.[12567]<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThere is no cure for HUV.

The prognosis largely depends on severity of systemic involvement and is influenced primarily by the severity of lung (pulmonary), heart, and kidney (renal) disease.[12566] &nbsp;When present, pulmonary disease (<a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/copd\" target=\"_blank\">COPD</a>) is the major cause of death. Cigarette smoking itself appears to be a strong risk factor for developing lung disease with HUV.[13035] Acute swelling of the larynx (laryngeal edema) can also be life-threatening. Although HUV is uncommon in childhood, the prognosis is worse for those affected at younger ages because of more frequent, severe renal involvement.[12566]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe prognosis can also be influenced by other underlying disorders that HUV is associated with.[13035] When HUV is associated with systemic lupus, the overlap of the two disease processes may cause relatively fast progression and poor prognosis, given that either disease can end fatally. Therefore, all patients diagnosed with HUV should also be examined for lupus (and possibly vice versa).[13035]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause the symptoms and severity of HUV vary, it is not possible to predict the life expectancy for affected individuals.","dateModified":"2017-02-06T12:27:00","resourceClassificationName":"Prognosis","references":[{"referenceId":12566,"authors":"Gasim AH & Jennette C","articleTitle":"Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet","date":"May 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=EN&Expert=36412","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13035,"authors":"Andrew Buck,Jim Christensen, and Morgan McCarty","articleTitle":"Hypocomplementemic Urticarial Vasculitis Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Clin Aesthet Dermatol","date":"January, 2012","volume":"5(1)","pages":"36-46","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3277093/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12739,"relatedDiseaseName":"Secondary glomerular disease","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
