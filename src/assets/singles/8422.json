The most common affected parts are the eyes. PPS causes&nbsp;abnormal development of the structures in the front of the eye, known as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/peters-anomaly/\" target=\"_blank\">Peters anomaly</a>. Other symptoms include limited growth, short limbs, cleft lip and/or palate, distinctive face, and developmental or intellectual disability. Less common symptoms may include heart and kidney abnormalities.  The severity of symptoms varies from person to person. Because PPS has only been reported in a small number of people, it is not clear how this condition changes with age. PPS is caused by a variant in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/B3GLCT\" target=\"_blank\">B3GLCT</a></em>&nbsp;gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>  fashion.
