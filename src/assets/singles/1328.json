Ring chromosome 15 is caused by an abnormal chromosome known as a ring chromosome 15 or r(15). A <a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ring-chromosome\" target=\"_blank\">ring chromosome</a> is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and the broken ends fuse together. The features of ring chromosome 15 appear to result from the loss (<a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=45\" target=\"_blank\">deletion</a>) of genetic material from the long (q) arm of chromosome 15. Ring chromosome 15 is usually caused by spontaneous (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/de-novo-mutation/\" target=\"_blank\">de novo</a>) errors very early in embryonic development.[11455][11456] In rare cases, it is passed through families, either from a parent who also has a ring chromosome 15, or from a parent who has a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/structuralchanges\" target=\"_blank\">balanced translocation</a>.[11455] Treatment for ring chromosome 15 is focused on addressing the symptoms present in each individual and may require a team of medical specialists.[11455][11456]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2016-05-04T08:23:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
