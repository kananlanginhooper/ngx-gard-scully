Cutis laxa can also affect connective tissue in other parts of the body, including the heart, blood vessels, joints, intestines, and lungs. Depending on which organs and tissues are affected, the signs and symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening.[3637]&nbsp;It may be acquired or inherited. The different forms of inherited cutis laxa are distinguished by their pattern of inheritance: <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002051.htm\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked</a>.
