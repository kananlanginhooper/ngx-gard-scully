The cerebellum normally coordinates movement and the pons (located in the brainstem) transmits signals from the cerebellum to the rest of the brain. Several forms of PCH have been described, each having some different signs and symptoms but all characterized by problems with movement, delayed psychomotor development, and intellectual disability. Although each form has a different genetic cause, they are all inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=_blank>autosomal recessive</a> manner.[5697][5698] Many children with PCH live only into infancy or childhood, although some individuals have lived into adulthood.[5697] Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.[5698]","dateModified":"2012-12-18T11:45:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6608,"questionText":"What causes pontocerebellar hypoplasia?","answerText":"The different forms of pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) are generally caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=_blank>mutations</a> in several different <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=_blank>genes</a>.
