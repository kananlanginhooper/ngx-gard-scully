The disease has a bimodal distribution and manifests in those younger than age 5, juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JORRP), and those older than age 40, adult-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (AORRP). JORRP is more common and more severe in presentation than AORRP. In a small percentage of patients, respiratory papillomas may undergo malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinomas that have a poor prognosis.","Disease__c":"Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C1168198","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
