The different types are classified based on the amount and type of enzyme activity present in the affected individual.[1929]<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Classic maple syrup urine disease</em>&nbsp;is the most common type. Individuals with classic maple syrup urine disease have little or no enzyme activity (usually less than 2 % of normal). Infants with this type of maple syrup urine disease will show symptoms within the first several days of life.&nbsp;It is managed through diet with severe protein restriction. \r\n<li><em>Intermediate maple syrup urine disease</em> is a variant of the classic type. Individuals with intermediate maple syrup urine disease have a higher level of enzyme activity (approximately 3 to 8% of normal) and can tolerate a greater amount of leucine. However, in periods of illness or fasting, these individuals may react like a child with the classic type of maple syrup urine disease. Management is similar to that used for the classic type. \r\n<li><em>Intermittent maple syrup urine disease</em> is a milder form of the disease. Individuals with this type have a greater level of enzyme activity (approximately 8 to 15% of normal) and&nbsp;often do not have symptoms until&nbsp;12 to 24 months of age, usually as a result of an illness or surge in protein intake. During&nbsp;an illness,&nbsp;an individual with intermittent maple syrup urine disease&nbsp;may exhibit a strong maple syrup odor and/or go into a metabolic crisis. \r\n<li><em>Thiamine-responsive maple syrup urine</em> disease is so&nbsp;named because large doses of thiamine given to these individuals will result in an increase in the enzyme activity&nbsp;which breaks down leucine, isoleucine and valine.&nbsp;Only moderate protein restriction is needed to manage this type of&nbsp;maple syrup urine disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>","dateModified":"2012-05-10T14:55:00","references":[{"referenceId":1929,"authors":"","articleTitle":"MSUD Classifications","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"MSUD Family Support Group","date":"2010","url":"http://www.msud-support.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=307&Itemid=88","dateAccessed":"2012-05-10T00:00:00"}]},{"questionId":2921,"questionText":"Is it possible for an adult to develop&nbsp;maple syrup urine disease?","answerText":"At times&nbsp;a peculiar maple syrup smell in the urine or sweat can occur in older, healthy children or adults who are non-symptomatic.
