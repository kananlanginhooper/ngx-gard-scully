It is characterized by shortening of the bones in the upper arms and thighs (rhizomelia). People with RCDP have very poor growth and often develop joint deformities (contractures) that make the joints stiff and painful. Other major features include distinctive facial features, intellectual disability, clouding of the lenses of the eyes (cataracts), heart defects, and respiratory problems.[13543][13544] There are 5 types of RCDP, classified according to the associated gene mutations:[13544]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6049/rhizomelic-chondrodysplasia-punctata-type-1\" target=\"_blank\">RCDP1</a> with&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PEX7\">PEX7</a>&nbsp;</em>gene<br />\r\nRCDP2 with&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GNPAT\">GNPAT</a>&nbsp;</em>gene<br />\r\nRCDP3 with <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/AGPS\">AGPS</a>&nbsp;</em>gene<br />\r\nRCDP4 (peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 disorder) with&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.omim.org/entry/616107?search=FAR1%20gene&amp;highlight=gene%20far1\" target=\"_blank\">FAR1</a>&nbsp;</em>gene<br />\r\nRCDP5 with&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.omim.org/entry/600414\" target=\"_blank\">PEX5</a>&nbsp;</em>gene &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n</span><span></span><span>All these genes are involved in the formation and function of sac-like cell structures called peroxisomes that contain enzymes needed to break down many substances, including fatty acids known as plasmalogens.[13543] Deficiency of plasmalogen affects bone growth.[13544] Inheritance is  autosomal recessive.&nbsp;</span><span>There is no cure for RCDP. Treatment is &nbsp;symptomatic  and may include physiotherapy and orthopedic procedures, eye surgery, and nutritional plans. For example, RCDP1 patients may need diet restriction</span>&nbsp;of phytanic acid.[13544][13542]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n</p>","dateModified":"2017-07-07T13:24:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":13319,"relatedDiseaseName":"Peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 disorder","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":8398,"relatedDiseaseName":"Peroxisome disorders","relation":"Parent","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":6049,"relatedDiseaseName":"Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":9429,"relatedDiseaseName":"Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 2","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":9682,"relatedDiseaseName":"Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 3","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":13320,"relatedDiseaseName":"Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 5","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
