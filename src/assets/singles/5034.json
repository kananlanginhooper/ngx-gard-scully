The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition <em>and</em> not be a carrier.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the condition is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes (the Y chromosome is the other sex chromosome).

X-linked conditions can be <a href=\"http://www.genetics.edu.au/Publications-and-Resources/Genetics-Fact-Sheets/FactSheet10A\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked dominant</a> or <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002051.htm\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked recessive</a>. The inheritance is X-linked dominant if one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Women with an X-linked dominant condition have a 50% chance of passing the condition on to a son or a daughter with each pregnancy. Men with an X-linked dominant condition will pass the condition on to all of their daughters and none of their sons. The inheritance is X-linked recessive if a gene on the X chromosome causes the condition in men with one gene mutation (they have only one X chromosome) and in females with two gene mutations (they have two X chromosomes). A woman with an X-linked condition will pass the mutation on to all of her sons and daughters. This means that all of her sons will have the condition and all of her daughters will be carriers. A man with an X-linked recessive condition will pass the mutation to all of his daughters (carriers) and none of his sons.","dateModified":"2015-04-13T20:03:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[{"referenceId":8640,"authors":"Sandrock K, Zieger B.","articleTitle":"Current Strategies in Diagnosis of Inherited Storage Pool Defects","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Transfus Med Hemother","date":"2010","volume":"37(5)","pages":"248-258","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":2906,"questionText":"How&nbsp;is platelet storage pool&nbsp;deficiency diagnosed?","answerText":"A diagnosis of platelet storage pool deficiency is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms.
