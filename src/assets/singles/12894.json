Zika virus can also be spread from a pregnant mother to her child and through sexual contact with an affected partner. Cases of Zika virus transmission via blood transfusion have also been reported.[10827] Zika virus outbreaks are currently occurring in many countries.[10828] The illness associated with Zika virus infection is usually mild, with symptoms lasting for several days to a week. The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes).[11256] However, research has suggested an association between Zika virus infection and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/6554/guillain-barre-syndrome/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">Guillain-Barre syndrome</a> (GBS) in a small percentage of cases.[10829] Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause adverse pregnancy outcomes, including <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/3603/microcephaly/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">microcephaly</a> and other serious brain defects. The full range of health problems associated with Zika virus infection during pregnancy is currently being studied. [10827][11257] No vaccine currently exists to prevent Zika virus infection, but there are still ways to protect oneself. The CDC recommends that pregnant women consider postponing travel to Zika-affected areas. People living in or traveling to areas where Zika virus is found should take steps to <a href=\"http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/avoid-bug-bites\" target=\"_blank\">prevent mosquito bites</a>.
