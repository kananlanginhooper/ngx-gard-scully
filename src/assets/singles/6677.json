However, the disease affects everyone differently; the age of onset, specific symptoms, and rate of progression varies for each person with HD.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the symptoms of HD are well-characterized, their progression (especially in the early and middle stages) remains unpredictable. With the approach of late-stage HD, affected people have speech difficulty and weight loss. In the late stage, affected people lose bowel and bladder control.[9842]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe duration of the disease (from onset until death) varies considerably, with an average of approximately 19 years. Most people with HD survive for 10-25 years after the onset of symptoms. The average age at death ranges from 51-57 years, but the range may be broader. In a large study, pneumonia and cardiovascular (heart) disease were the most common primary causes of death.[9841]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe length of the CAG repeat (the type of mutation in the HTT gene responsible for HD) is the most important factor that determines age of onset of HD. However, there is still a lot of variability. Both genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role on the age of onset in people with a mutation.
