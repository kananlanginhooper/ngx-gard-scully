IgA nephropathy can occur at any age, even in childhood. After many years, deposits of IgA may cause the kidneys to leak blood and sometimes protein in the urine.&nbsp;In the early stages, IgA nephropathy has no symptoms.&nbsp;The first sign of this condition&nbsp;may be blood in the urine. After 10 to 20 years, the kidneys may show signs of damage and 20-40% of adults develop end-stage kidney disease.[1565]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn most instances, the cause of this condition is unknown; however, certain disorders have been linked with IgA nephropathy, such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/8849.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cirrhosis of the liver</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/11998/celiac-disease\" target=\"_blank\">celiac disease</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/hivaids.html\" target=\"_blank\">HIV infection</a>. Although IgA nephropathy usually occurs in a family with no other affected members, several cases of familial IgA nephropathy have been reported.[12615] Familial IgA nephropathy is suspected to run through families in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>  manner and is linked to genetic material on the long arm of <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/6\" target=\"_blank\">chromosome 6</a> (6q22-23).[12615][12616] There is no cure for this condition.
