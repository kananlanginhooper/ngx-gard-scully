PHA is considered to be a benign disorder in most instances, as individuals with PHA are typically healthy.[4607] PHA is caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>  in the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LBR\" target=\"_blank\">LBR</a></em>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a>.
