Fractures occur less frequently in adulthood. People with mild forms of the condition typically have a blue or grey tint to the part of the eye that is usually white (the sclera), and may develop hearing loss in adulthood. Affected individuals are usually of normal or near normal height. Most of the mutations that cause osteogenesis imperfecta type&nbsp;1 occur in the <span class=\"geneSymbol\"><em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/COL1A1\" target=\"_blank\">COL1A1</a></em></span> gene. These genetic changes reduce the amount of type I collagen produced in the body, which causes bones to be brittle and to fracture easily.
