AVMD affects an area of the retina called the <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/9608.htm\" target=\"_blank\">macula</a>, which is responsible for sharp central vision. The condition causes a fatty yellow pigment to accumulate in cells underlying the macula, eventually damaging the cells.[5431] AVMD usually begins after age 40. Some people remain without symptoms throughout their life. Other people with AVMD may slowly develop blurred and/or distorted vision, that can progress to central vision loss over time.[5431][10864] In the past, AVMD was believed to be mainly a genetic disorder caused by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PRPH2\" target=\"_blank\">PRPH2</a>,&nbsp;</em><em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/BEST1\" target=\"_blank\">BEST1</a>, <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IMPG1\" target=\"_blank\">IMPG1</a>, and <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IMPG2\" target=\"_blank\">IMPG2</a></em> genes; however, recent studies focused on genetic testing suggest that the genetic cause for most cases of AVMD has not been found.[10864][10863] Sometimes AVMD clearly runs in families  in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner, but the inheritance is suspected to be more complicated in the majority of cases.
