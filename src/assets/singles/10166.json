It is a rare but very serious condition that requires rapid intervention.  Symptoms include leak of clear fluid through the ear, inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain (<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/meningitis.html\" target=\"_blank\">meningitis</a>), hearing loss, and seizures.
