Kidney disease typically begins in the first few months of life, often leading to kidney failure in childhood. In addition, up to 90 percent of people with this condition develop a rare form of kidney cancer known as <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001575.htm\" target=_blank>Wilms tumor</a>. Males with Denys-Drash syndrome have gonadal dysgenesis, a condition in which the external genitalia do not look clearly male or clearly female (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003269.htm\" target=_blank>ambiguous genitalia</a>) or the genitalia appear to be completely female. The <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000973.htm\" target=_blank>testes are also undescended</a>, meaning that they remain in the pelvis, abdomen, or groin. Affected females usually have normal genitalia. For this reason, females with this condition may be diagnosed with isolated <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000490.htm\" target=_blank>nephrotic syndrome</a>. Denys-Drash syndrome is caused by mutations in the <span class=geneSymbol><span><u><font color=#0066cc><em>WT1</em></font></u></span></span> gene. This condition is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=_blank>autosomal dominant</a> pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

This gene provides instructions for making a protein (the WT1 protein) that regulates the activity of other genes by attaching (binding) to specific regions of DNA. The WT1 protein plays a role in the development of the kidneys and gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males) before birth.[6302]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <em>WT1</em> gene mutations that cause Denys-Drash syndrome lead to the production of an abnormal protein that cannot bind to DNA. As a result, the activity of certain genes is unregulated, which impairs the development of the kidneys and reproductive organs. Abnormal development of these organs leads to diffuse glomerulosclerosis (where scar tissue forms throughout glomeruli, the tiny blood vessels in the kidney that filter waste from blood) and <a href=\"http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/gonadal+dysgenesis\" target=\"_blank\">gonadal dysgenesis</a>, which are characteristic features of Denys-Drash syndrome. The abnormal gene activity caused by the loss of normal WT1 protein also increases the risk of developing Wilms tumor in affected individuals.[6302]","dateModified":"2015-06-03T16:19:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":6302,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Denys-Drash syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"March 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/denys-drash-syndrome","dateAccessed":"2015-06-03T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":8908,"questionText":"Is Denys-Drash syndrome inherited?","answerText":"Denys-Drash syndrome is inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>&nbsp;pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.
