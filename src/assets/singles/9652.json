FGF23 inhibits the ability of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/kidneysandurinarysystem.html\">kidneys</a>&nbsp;to absorb phosphate.[13962] Phosphate is important for keeping bones strong and healthy. Therefore, this disease is characterized by a softening and weakening of the bones (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000376.htm\">osteomalacia</a>). The disease also results in multiple biochemical abnormalities including high levels of phosphate in the urine (hyperphosphaturia) and low levels of phosphate in the blood (<a href=\"https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/hormonal-and-metabolic-disorders/electrolyte-balance/hypophosphatemia-low-level-of-phosphate-in-the-blood\">hypophosphatemia</a>).
