The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://kidshealth.org/en/kids/word-mucous-membrane.html\" target=\"_blank\">mucous membranes</a>&nbsp;of the eyes, mouth, and/or genitals are also commonly affected.[14967] SJS and TEN previously were thought to be&nbsp;separate conditions, but they are now considered part of a disease spectrum. SJS is at the less severe end of the spectrum, and TEN is at the more severe end.[12150] It is considered SJS when skin detachment involves less than 10% of the body surface, and TEN when skin detachment involves more than 30% of the body surface. People with skin detachment involving 10-30% of the body surface are said to have \"SJS/TEN overlap.\"[14967] All forms of SJS/TEN are a&nbsp;medical emergency that can be life-threatening.[12150][2146]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first symptoms of SJS/TEN often include fever and&nbsp;flu-like symptoms (such as general ill feeling, body aches, and cough).[14967][2146] Within about 1 to 3 days, a red or purplish rash forms, and then the skin begins to blister and peel, leading to \"raw\" areas of skin that are painful.[14967][12150] This often starts on the face and then spreads to other parts of the body.[14967][12150] The mucous membranes may also become involved during this time, which can lead to symptoms such as severe&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001010.htm\" target=\"_blank\">conjunctivitis</a> (when the eyes are affected), trouble swallowing and breathing (when the mouth and airway are affected), and difficulty urinating and genital pain (when the genitals are affected).[14967][12150]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSJS/TEN often is triggered by certain medications including <a href=\"https://www.arthritis.org/about-arthritis/types/gout/treatments/medication.php\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682673.html\" target=\"_blank\">allopurinol</a>, <a href=\"https://www.epilepsysociety.org.uk/list-anti-epileptic-drugs#.W7t772hKiM8\" target=\"_blank\">anti-epileptics</a>, pain relievers, cancer therapies, or antibiotics (sometimes up to 2 weeks after stopping the medication). SJS/TEN can also be triggered by infections such as pneumonia, herpes virus, and hepatitis A. In many cases the cause cannot be identified.[12150][2146] People that may be at increased risk to develop SJS/TEN include those with HIV, a weakened immune system, a personal or family history of the condition, and certain variations of a gene called\r\n<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HLA-B\" target=\"_blank\">HLA-B</a></em>.[12150][2146] There are no universal diagnostic criteria for SJS/TEN. Currently the diagnosis is based on the person's medical history and symptoms.[14967] People suspected of having SJS/TEN should be admitted to the hospital to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity.[14418] As mentioned earlier, whether a person is diagnosed specifically with SJS, TEN, or SJS/TEN overlap depends on the percentage of body surface area affected.[14967]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment needs should be assessed in the hospital to determine severity and where treatment should be provided (e.g. intensive care unit, burn unit, or dermatology unit). Treatment may involve stopping a triggering medication (for those suspected of having medication-induced SJS/TEN), standard therapies used for major burns, various eye treatments (for those with eye involvement), pain control, and preventing and treating infections.[14418]&nbsp;The overall mortality rate is about 25%, ranging from about 10% for SJS to over 30% for TEN.

People with SJS/TEN may be best treated in an intensive care unit, burn unit, or specialized dermatology unit.

Eye inflammation can worsen quickly within a few days, so daily eye evaluations (by an ophthalmologist) and aggressive treatment are needed.
