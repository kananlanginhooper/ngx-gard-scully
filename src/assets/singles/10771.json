HH affects the production of the hormones needed for sexual development. It is present from birth and is due to deficiency of <a href=\"http://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/gonadotrophinreleasing_hormone.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">gonadotropin-releasing hormone</a> (GnRH). KS is often diagnosed at puberty due to lack of sexual development. It may first be suspected in infancy in males with <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000973.htm\" target=\"_blank\">undescended testicles</a> or a small penis. Symptoms in untreated, adult males may include decreased bone density and muscle mass; small testicles; <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/erectiledysfunction.html\" target=\"_blank\">erectile dysfunction</a>; low sex drive; and infertility. Untreated adult females with KS usually do not have menstrual periods (amenorrhea) and normal, little, or no breast development. Rarely, a person with KS will have failure of kidney development (renal agenesis); hearing impairment; <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001051.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cleft lip or palate</a>; and/or dental abnormalities.

The main features  are delayed or absent signs of puberty, and absent or diminished sense of smell (anosmia or hyposmia, respectively).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMales with KS may have  signs of the condition at birth, such as undescended testes or a smaller than average penis. However, most cases are diagnosed at the time of puberty due to lack of sexual development. Males usually have no growth of facial or body hair, and decreased growth of pubic hair and genitals. They also have a delayed pubertal growth spurt in comparison to their peers. If not treated, adult males may have decreased bone density and muscle mass; decreased testicular volume; erectile dysfunction; low sex drive; and infertility.[8396][8402]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFemales with KS usually have absent breast development, an attenuated growth spurt, decreased pubic hair growth, and no initiation of menses (<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001218.htm\" target=\"_blank\">primary amenorrhea</a>). However, some females partially undergo puberty with the beginning of breast development that fails to progress. Very occasionally, affected females have onset of menses at an appropriate age, but it stops after a few cycles.[8402]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn both males and females, development of pubic hair can be normal because it is controlled by secretion of androgens from the adrenal glands, which are not affected by the condition.[8402] Almost all untreated people with KS are infertile, but fertility can be restored in those that respond to certain treatments.[8401]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome people with KS have any of various non-reproductive features.
