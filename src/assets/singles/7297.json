Signs and symptoms may include pelvic pain, a pelvic mass, or the absence of menopause after oophorectomy. The condition may be caused by surgical factors leading to incomplete removal of ovarian tissue, including factors that limit surgical exposure of the ovary or compromise surgical technique. Factors may include pelvic adhesions (limiting ability to see the ovary or causing it to adhere to other tissues); anatomic variations; bleeding during surgery; or poor surgical technique. Treatment is indicated for people with symptoms and typically involves surgery to remove the residual tissue. Therapy for those who refuse surgery, cannot have surgery, or do not have a pelvic mass may include hormonal therapy to suppress ovarian function.[12685]","dateModified":"2016-12-02T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6598,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of ovarian remnant syndrome?","answerText":"The most common symptom of ovarian remnant syndrome (ORS) is&nbsp;pelvic pain.
