Treatment generally focuses on managing signs and symptoms. For some individuals, such as those that have a mild form of dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DDEB), dystrophic nails may be the only manifestation. However, other individuals may have much more severe problems that need to be managed. Management typically focuses on treating blisters and avoiding or treating infections.[3103]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWound care usually included treatment of new blisters by lancing and draining. Additionally in most cases, wounds are then dressed with a non-adherent material, covered with padding for stability and protection, and secured with an elastic wrap for integrity. Due to the increased risk of bacterial resistance, topical antibiotic ointments and antimicrobial dressings should be reserved for those wounds that are colonized with bacteria and fail to heal, referred to as &ldquo;critical colonization.\"[3103][11190]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndividuals with epidermolysis bullosa (EB)  have increased caloric and protein needs due to the increased energy utilized in wound healing.

Treatment generally focuses on managing signs and symptoms. For some individuals, such as those that have a mild form of dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DDEB), dystrophic nails may be the only manifestation. However, other individuals may have much more severe problems that need to be managed. Management typically focuses on treating blisters and avoiding or treating infections.[3103]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWound care usually included treatment of new blisters by lancing and draining. Additionally in most cases, wounds are then dressed with a non-adherent material, covered with padding for stability and protection, and secured with an elastic wrap for integrity. Due to the increased risk of bacterial resistance, topical antibiotic ointments and antimicrobial dressings should be reserved for those wounds that are colonized with bacteria and fail to heal, referred to as &ldquo;critical colonization.\"[3103][11190]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndividuals with epidermolysis bullosa (EB)  have increased caloric and protein needs due to the increased energy utilized in wound healing. Involvement of the digestive system in some forms of EB may limit nutritional intake. Infants and children with more severe forms of EB and <a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/parent/medical/endocrine/failure_thrive.html\" target=\"_blank\">failure to thrive</a> usually require attention to <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/fluidandelectrolytebalance.html\" target=\"_blank\">fluid and electrolyte balance</a> and may require nutritional support, including a <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000165.htm\" target=\"_blank\">gastrotomy feeding tube</a>. <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/anemia.html\" target=\"_blank\">Anemia</a> is typically&nbsp;treated with iron supplements and transfusions as needed. Other nutritional supplements may include calcium, vitamin D, selenium, carnitine, and zinc.[3103][11190]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSurveillance is important for individuals with DEB. Biopsies of abnormal-appearing wounds that do not heal may be recommended&nbsp;in some types of DEB due to predisposition to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.skinsight.com/adult/squamousCellCarcinomaSCC.htm\" target=\"_blank\">squamous cell carcinoma</a>, beginning in the second decade of life. Screening for deficiencies of iron, zinc, vitamin D, selenium, and carnitine is typically recommended after the first year of life. Routine <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003869.htm\" target=\"_blank\">echocardiograms</a> are recommended to identify <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000168.htm\" target=\"_blank\">dilated cardiomyopathy</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007197.htm\" target=\"_blank\">bone mineral density studies</a> are recommended to identify <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/osteoporosis.html\" target=\"_blank\">osteoporosis</a>.
