The outcome for mothers with HELLP is generally good, but serious complications are relatively common. In most cases, after delivery, a mother's signs and symptoms begin to improve within 2 days. However, some women experience complications. The risk of serious complications generally is higher for women with severe symptoms and for those with more severe laboratory abnormalities. Examples of complications include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000573.htm\" target=\"_blank\">disseminated intravascular coagulation</a> (DIC), <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/placental-abruption/symptoms-causes/syc-20376458\" target=\"_blank\">placental abruption</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000501.htm\" target=\"_blank\">acute kidney failure</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000140.htm\" target=\"_blank\">pulmonary edema</a>. However, these complications are related. For example, placental abruption can cause DIC, which then may cause acute kidney failure; acute kidney failure may lead to pulmonary edema. Of note, HELLP syndrome with or without kidney failure does not affect long-term kidney function. Other complications that have been reported include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000103.htm\" target=\"_blank\">adult respiratory distress syndrome</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000666.htm\" target=\"_blank\">sepsis</a>, and stroke.[5933]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe prognosis for a fetus or newborn of a mother with HELLP syndrome is thought to largely depend on the gestational age at delivery and birth weight (rather than the fact that HELLP syndrome was present, or the severity of signs and symptoms). This means that in many cases, the longer the pregnancy continues, the better the chance for survival and good health for the baby. Premature birth is common in mothers with HELLP syndrome.[5933] The rate of preterm delivery is 70%, with 15% occurring before 28 weeks of gestation.[14654] This is the leading cause of fetal or newborn death, with the overall risk of death ranging from 7 to 20 percent.[5933][14654]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe mother's laboratory abnormalities are not thought to be related to the chance of survival of a fetus or newborn. Additionally, HELLP syndrome does not affect liver function in the fetus or newborn.[5933][14654] Unfortunately, there is very limited data available regarding the long-term follow-up of children born to mothers with HELLP syndrome.","dateModified":"2018-05-23T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Prognosis","references":[{"referenceId":5933,"authors":"Sibai BM","articleTitle":"HELLP syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"Feb 20, 2018","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hellp-syndrome","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"Waltham, MA","publisher":"UpToDate"},{"referenceId":14654,"authors":"Cavaignac-Vitalis M, Vidal F, Simon-Toulza C, Boulot P, Guerby P, Chantalat E, Parant O","articleTitle":"Conservative versus active management in HELLP syndrome: results from a cohort study","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med","date":"December, 2017","volume":"21","pages":"1-7","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29228827","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
