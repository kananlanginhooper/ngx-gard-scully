The question of whether to continue lifelong warfarin in patients with identified protein S deficiency after their first thrombotic event is controversial. If the first thrombotic event was life threatening or occurred in multiple or unusual sites (i.e. cerebral veins, mesenteric veins), most experts recommend lifelong therapy initially. If brought about especially abruptly&nbsp;by a strong event (i.e. trauma, surgery) and the thrombosis did not meet the criteria of life threatening or multiple or unusual sites, some experts argue that these patients may have a lower risk of recurrence and deserve a trial without warfarin after 9 months.\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 0px;\" dir=\"ltr\">In patients who are asymptomatic carriers of protein S deficiency, the goal of therapy is prevention of the first thrombosis.

The question of whether to continue lifelong warfarin in patients with identified protein S deficiency after their first thrombotic event is controversial. If the first thrombotic event was life threatening or occurred in multiple or unusual sites (i.e. cerebral veins, mesenteric veins), most experts recommend lifelong therapy initially. If brought about especially abruptly&nbsp;by a strong event (i.e. trauma, surgery) and the thrombosis did not meet the criteria of life threatening or multiple or unusual sites, some experts argue that these patients may have a lower risk of recurrence and deserve a trial without warfarin after 9 months.\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 0px;\" dir=\"ltr\">In patients who are asymptomatic carriers of protein S deficiency, the goal of therapy is prevention of the first thrombosis.
