Some sources call&nbsp;MOPD type 2 \"Majewski osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type 2\" so these may be synonynous. Majewski was&nbsp;one of the authors of several publications who originally defined three types of osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (and distinguished them from another disorder called Seckel syndrome) in the 1980s. However, there has since been consensus that MOPD types 1 and 3, described by Majewski and others, are actually variations of the same condition.[4648]","dateModified":"2011-11-11T13:59:00","references":[{"referenceId":4648,"authors":"Ada Hamosh","articleTitle":"MICROCEPHALIC OSTEODYSPLASTIC PRIMORDIAL DWARFISM, TYPE I; MOPD1","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"OMIM","date":"April 22, 2011","url":"http://omim.org/entry/210710","dateAccessed":"2011-11-11T00:00:00"}]},{"questionId":5638,"questionText":"How do the different&nbsp;types of microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (MOPD) differ&nbsp;in terms of genetics?","answerText":"All types of microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (MOPD) appear to be inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=_blank>autosomal recessive</a> manner. This means that affected individuals have abnormal gene changes (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=_blank>mutations</a>) in both copies of the disease-causing gene, with one copy inherited from each parent. The parents who each carry one abnormal copy of the gene are referred to as carriers; carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of an autosomal recessive condition. When two carriers have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier.<br>&nbsp;<br>MOPD types 1 and 3 were previously thought to be separate entities, but more recent evidence has supported the notion that they are in fact the same.[4648] Hence, the more recent literature often lumps these two together, often referring to them now&nbsp;as MOPD 1.
