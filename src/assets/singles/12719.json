In AD-CNM, specifically, the severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary significantly among affected people. In people with a mild form, features of the condition generally don't develop until adolescence or early adulthood and may include slowly progressive muscle weakness, muscle pain with exercise and difficulty walking. Although some affected people will eventually lose the ability to walk, this usually does not occur before the 6th decade of life. In more severe cases, affected people may develop symptoms during infancy or early childhood such as <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003298.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypotonia</a> and generalized weakness. These children generally have delayed motor milestones and often need wheelchair assistance in childhood or adolescence.
