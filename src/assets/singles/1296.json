On x-ray, infants with CDPX1 have characteristic spots&nbsp;at the ends of their bones. These spots are called chondrodysplasia punctata or stippled epiphyses and typically disappear between ages 2 and 3.&nbsp;Additional common features of CDPX1 are shortened fingers and a flattened nose. Some people with this condition have breathing abnormalities, hearing loss, abnormalities of the spinal bones in the neck, and intellectual delays.[1126][12020]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCDPX1 is caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>  in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ARSE\" target=\"_blank\"><em>ARSE</em></a> gene, which is located on the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome=X\" target=\"_blank\">X chromosome</a>.
