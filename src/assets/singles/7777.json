Onset can occur at any age.[5944] Signs and symptoms include a constant pain behind the eye; decreased eye movements; and signs of cranial nerve paralysis such as drooping of the upper eyelid (ptosis), double vision (diplopia), large pupil, and facial numbness.[5944][5947] Although it is considered a benign condition, permanent neurologic deficits can occur and relapses are common. The features of THS are caused by inflammation of the cavernous sinus (an area at the base of the brain) but the underlying cause of the inflammation is unknown. Left untreated, symptoms may resolve spontaneously after an average of about eight weeks. Treatment may include use of glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive therapies.[5944]","dateModified":"2013-03-25T13:49:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6823,"questionText":"How might Tolosa Hunt syndrome be treated?","answerText":"Left untreated, symptoms may resolve spontaneously after an average of about eight weeks. <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/steroids.html\" target=_blank>Glucocorticoids</a> have long been the recommended treatment for Tolosa Hunt syndrome.
