The most common medication include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682004.html\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">hydroxyurea</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a690006.html\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">interferon-alpha</a>, Phosphorus 32,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a601020.html\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">anagrelide</a>. Aspirin in low doses can be used to control microvascular symptoms such as redness and pain in the fingers and toes, insufficient blood flow (ischemia), infections in the limbs (gangrene), strokes, syncopes, instability or visual disturbances.[1257][4156][4555]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe classification of the disease according to the risks is as following:[14098]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li class=\"bulletIndent1\"><strong>High-risk disease</strong>: People who had&nbsp;&nbsp;thrombosis at any age <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span>&nbsp;who are older than 60 years of age and have a&nbsp;<em>JAK2 V617F</em> mutation</li>\r\n    <li class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Intermediate-risk disease</strong>: People who are older than 60 years of age, who do not have a&nbsp;</span><em style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">JAK2</em><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> mutation and who never had thrombosis</span></li>\r\n    <li class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Low-risk disease</strong>: People who are 60 years of age or </span>younger<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">, and who have a&nbsp;</span><em style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">JAK2</em><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> mutation and never had thrombosis</span></li>\r\n    <li class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Very-low-risk disease</strong>: People who are 60 years of age or younger</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">&nbsp;without a  </span><em style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">JAK2</em><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> mutation and never had thrombosis.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nRecent studies have made the following recommendations:[14098]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>People who have a high risk of thrombosis or who had thrombosis should use a cytoreductor in combination with an anticoagulant</li>\r\n    <li>People with high or intermediate risk, should be treated with a cytoreductor in combination with aspirin at low doses&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>People who are at low risk should be treated with low doses of aspirin or are only observed carefully without any type of treatment</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHydroxyurea is the preferred cytoreductive drug for most people, because it is less toxic and has a lower risk of producing myelofibrosis. However, in pregnant women and in those women who wish to become pregnant, interferon is used because  hydroxyurea or anagrelide may cause birth defects.[4156][14098]<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2017-11-24T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":1257,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Primary thrombocythemia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia","date":"2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000543.htm","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":4156,"authors":"Lal A","articleTitle":"Essential Thrombocytosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape","date":"2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/206697-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":4555,"authors":"Tefferi A","articleTitle":"Myeloproliferative disorders: Essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Cecil Medicine 23rd ed","date":"2007","volume":"177","authors2":"Goldman L & Ausiello D","placeOfPublication":"Philadelphia, Pa","publisher":"Saunders Elsevier"},{"referenceId":14098,"authors":"Tefferi A","articleTitle":"Prognosis and treatment of essential thrombocythemia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"September 08, 2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-essential-thrombocythemia","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":2056,"questionText":"What is the long term outlook for essential thrombocythemia?","answerText":"Because the symptoms vary from person to person, the prognosis is also different from person to person.
