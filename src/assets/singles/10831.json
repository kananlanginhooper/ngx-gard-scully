The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that may occur in people with chromosome 1q duplications include developmental delay and learning disabilities, slow growth and/or short stature, various birth defects (such as cleft palate or heart defect) and specific facial features (such as a small, receding jaw).[8856] Most cases are not inherited from a parent, but a person with the duplication can pass it on to his/her children. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.","dateModified":"2017-07-12T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":11785,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of chromosome 1q duplications?","answerText":"Symptoms of chromosome 1q duplications generally depend on the size and location of the duplication, and the genes involved. Therefore, symptoms vary. For example, people who have small duplications near the tip of the long (q) arm of chromosome 1 are often mildly affected, while those with larger duplications  often have more severe learning difficulties. Children with large duplications that extend to near the center of the chromosome tend to have more severe birth defects and a shortened life expectancy.[8856]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of the more common features that may occur in people with a chromosome 1q duplications include:<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>small and/or receding lower jaw</li>\r\n    <li>high and narrow roof of mouth (palate), and/or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001051.htm\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">cleft palate</a></li>\r\n    <li>learning difficulties and developmental delay</li>\r\n    <li>heart defects</li>\r\n    <li>slow growth and short stature</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBelow is a summary of some additional features that have been reported in people with certain types of chromosome 1q duplications, according to <a href=\"http://www.rarechromo.org/information/Chromosome%20%201/1q%20duplications%20%20FTNW.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a guide provided by Unique</a>.
