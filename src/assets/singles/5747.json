In many cases, the first sign  is painless swelling in the jaw. While it can be very aggressive, these tumors are rarely found outside of the jaw.[11288][11289] Treatment is complete surgical removal of the affected tissue.[11289]","dateModified":"2016-04-19T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":2715,"questionText":"What causes ameloblastoma?","answerText":"Ameloblastoma occurs when the cells that form the protective enamel on your teeth (ameloblasts) grow in excess.[11288] The reason for this abnormal growth is not well understood.
