Tests such as a CT scan or MRI of the brain, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/cerebrospinal-fluid-csf-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\">cerebrospinal fluid analysis</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003931.htm\" target=\"_blank\">EEG</a> may be needed to rule out other potential causes of headache and neurological symptoms.[15140] Genetic testing may confirm the subtype of FHM in a family. Treatment of hemiplegic migraine involves medications to alleviate pain, stop the migraines, and prevent future migraines. Severe headache attacks may require hospitalization.[15140] In most people with hemiplegic migraines, aura symptoms completely go away in between migraines and the migraines become less frequent with age.[494] Rarely, hemiplegic migraines may cause permanent neurological symptoms, cognitive impairment, stroke, coma, or death.[15140][494]<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2019-01-02T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13110,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of familial hemiplegic migraine?","answerText":"Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) commonly begins during childhood or adolescence.[494] It is characterized by <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/migraine-with-aura/symptoms-causes/syc-20352072\" target=\"_blank\">migraine with aura</a> along with motor impairment (such as weakness on one side of the body, known as hemiparesis), in addition to &ldquo;classic&rdquo; aura which is marked by visual, sensory, and/or speech disturbances.
