Granulomatous rosacea is a type&nbsp;of rosacea that occurs mainly around the cheeks, eyes, and mouth. The symptoms include yellowish-brown or pink bumps (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003233.htm\" target=\"_blank\">papules</a>) on the skin, thickening of the skin, and patchy redness.[15313] The cause of granulomatous rosacea is unknown, but both genetic and non-genetic&nbsp;factors contribute to this condition. Granulomatous rosacea can look like other skin conditions and may be difficult to diagnose. The diagnosis is usually made based on the symptoms and characteristic findings seen from a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003840.htm\" target=\"_blank\">skin biopsy</a>.[15314] Granulomatous rosacea usually occurs in adults, primarily in middle-aged women. Treatment is based on controlling the symptoms using medications, antibiotics, light therapy and other treatments.[15313] The long-term outlook for people with granulomatous rosacea depends on the severity of symptoms and the response to treatment. The main complications of this condition is social isolation, depression and low self-esteem.[15312] This type of rosacea is rare, but the exact prevalence is unknown.","dateModified":"2019-03-15T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":3365,"questionText":"What are the symptoms of granulomatous rosacea?","answerText":"The symptoms of granulomatous rosacea will vary from person to person and may change over time.
