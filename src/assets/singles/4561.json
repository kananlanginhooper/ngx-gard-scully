Pseudotumor cerebri literally translates to \"false brain tumor.\" This term was used because symptoms of IIH resemble those of brain tumors depsite no tumor being present. Symptoms of IIH may include severe headache, nausea and vomiting, altered vision, and pulsating sounds within the head. A person with IIH may also have symptoms such as a stiff neck, back or arm pain, eye pain,  and memory problems. If the condition remains untreated, permanent visual loss or blindness may develop.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the exact underlying cause of IIH is not known (idiopathic), it is likely due to high fluid pressure within the skull that is due to buildup, or poor absorption, of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003428.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cerebrospinal fluid</a> (CSF). IIH most often (but not always) occurs in young, overweight, females.&nbsp;When symptoms of intracranial pressure have an identifiable cause such as another underlying disease or medication, the condition is instead referred to as secondary IH.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment for IIH may include medications called carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to control the production of CSF. In some cases, weight loss may also be recommended. However, medications and/or weight loss are not effective in all cases.
