In general, management of this condition depends on the affected person's age and symptoms.[280][11824]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen a diagnosis of PWS is made, several evaluations are needed to assess the extent of the condition. For example, newborns should be assessed for sucking problems; infants should be assessed for development; and young children should have a vision exam.

Other associated conditions for which evaluations may be recommended include <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hypothyroidism.html\" target=\"_blank\">hypothyroidism</a>, scoliosis, behavioral problems, psychosis, and respiratory problems and sleep issues.[280][11824]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn infants, special feeding techniques may be needed. Young children often need early intervention, including physical therapy for muscle strength and reaching physical milestones, and speech therapy for language issues.&nbsp;Cryptorchidism may resolve on its own but usually requires hormonal and/or surgical treatment.&nbsp;When excessive eating begins and weight percentiles increase, affected children should be on a program of a well-balanced diet, exercise, and close supervision with food. A consultation with a dietitian is recommended. Behavioral problems may be addressed with special behavioral management programs. Serotonin uptake inhibitors have helped many affected teenagers and adults, particularly those with obsessive-compulsive symptoms.[280][11824]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGrowth hormone treatment can normalize height, increase lean body mass, increase mobility, and decrease fat mass. Controlled trials of growth hormone therapies have shown significant benefit from infancy through adulthood. Benefits may include an increase in language and cognitive skills, and better motor performance. Sex hormone replacement helps to produce secondary sex characteristics (those that develop during puberty) but is somewhat controversial due to possible behavior problems in males, risk of stroke, and hygiene concerns related to menstruation in females.[280][11824]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClinical trials investigating potential treatment options for people with PWS are ongoing.
