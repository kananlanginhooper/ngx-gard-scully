In individuals with Lynch syndrome the following lifetime risks for cancer are seen: CRC: 52%-82% (mean age at diagnosis 44-61 years). Endometrial cancer in females: 25%-60% (mean age at diagnosis 48-62 years). Gastric cancer: 6%-13% (mean age at diagnosis 56 years). Ovarian cancer: 4%-12% (mean age at diagnosis 42.5 years; ~30% are diagnosed < age 40 years). The risk for other Lynch syndrome-related cancers is lower, though substantially increased over general population rates.","Disease__c":"Turcot syndrome","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C0265325","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
