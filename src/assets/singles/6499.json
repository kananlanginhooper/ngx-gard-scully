It typically affects children between 9 months and 9 years of age. Skin lesions typically last at least 10 days and often last for several weeks. The lesions are usually preceded by an underlying infection (usually a virus), which may cause associated symptoms such as low-grade fever, sore throat, or symptoms of an upper respiratory infection. When GCS is associated with <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000279.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hepatitis B</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/epstein-barr/about-ebv.html\" target=\"_blank\">Epstein-Barr</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/cytomegalovirusinfections.html\" target=\"_blank\">cytomegalovirus</a> (CMV) infection, acute hepatitis may also occur. GCS is thought to be a hypersensitive response to the underlying infection. While in many countries the underlying cause is hepatitis B, this is rarely the cause in North America. GCS typically does not require treatment and goes away on its own within 1 to 3 months.[9700][9701] In some cases, a&nbsp;mild topical steroid cream may be prescribed to relieve itching.[9702]","dateModified":"2015-09-26T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":9466,"questionText":"What causes Gianotti Crosti syndrome?","answerText":"Gianotti Crosti syndrome (GCS) is thought to be due to a hypersensitive response to a previous infection. The underlying infection tends to correlate with the infectious agent endemic to a specific geographic region. For example, in Japan and Mediterranean countries, GCS is more commonly associated with hepatitis B virus infection. Since there is more universal use of hepatitis B immunization, Epstein-Barr virus is now the most common associated infection worldwide.
