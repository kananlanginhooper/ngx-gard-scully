Individuals with HSES have extremely high body temperatures and multiple organ failures. This condition often causes long term neurological problems or death. The cause of the HSES is unknown. There is no cure for HSES; however, different methods can be used to try to manage associated symptoms.[1208][12105]</span>","dateModified":"2016-08-26T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":1958,"questionText":"What causes hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome (HSES)?","answerText":"The cause of HSES is unknown.[1206] Some researchers believe that this condition is caused by a complex combination of genetic and environmental factors.[1207][12105] Researchers have proposed various factors that may contribute to the development of this condition, including infection, exposure to toxins in the environment, and overwrapping of infants with a fever.[1208]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2016-08-26T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":1206,"authors":"Rinka H, Yoshida T, Kubota T, Tsuruwa M, Fuke A, Yoshimoto A, Kan M, Miyazaki D, Arimoto H, Miyaichi T, Kaji A, Miyamoto S, Kuki I, Shiomi M","articleTitle":"Hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome--the markers for an early HSES diagnosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"BMC Pediatr","date":"October 16, 2008","volume":"8","pages":"43","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18922188","dateAccessed":"2009-05-19T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":1207,"authors":"S Sofer, B Yerushalmi, E Shahak, T Berenstein, and H Schulman","articleTitle":"Possible aetiology of haemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome in the Negev area of Israel","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Archives of Disease in Childhood","date":"October 1996","volume":"75","pages":"4","url":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1511758","dateAccessed":"2009-05-19T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":1208,"authors":"Palumbo EJ","articleTitle":"Hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Merck Manual for Healthcare Professionals","date":"May 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/pediatrics/miscellaneous-disorders-in-infants-and-children/hemorrhagic-shock-and-encephalopathy-syndrome-hses","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12105,"authors":"Ichiro Kuki, Masashi Shiomi, Shin Okazaki, Hisashi Kawawaki, Kiyotaka Tomiwa, Kiyoko Amo, Masao Togawa, Junichi Ishikawa, Hiroshi Rinka","articleTitle":"Characteristic Neuroradiologic Features in Hemorrhagic Shock and Encephalopathy Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Journal of Child Neurology","date":"Mar 2015","volume":"30(4)","pages":"468-475","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25512363","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[{"caseId":23755,"abbreviatedInquiry":"Is there any evidence that&nbsp;hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome is genetic and passed from parent to child?
