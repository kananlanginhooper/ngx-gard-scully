These tumors, which are usually painless, tend to grow quickly, but rarely spread outside of the breast.[11813][11814] Most phyllodes tumors are benign. About 1 in 10 are cancerous.[11813] The underlying cause of these tumors in unknown.[11815] Surgery is the main treatment. Because the tumors can reoccur if they are not removed with enough surrounding tissue, the tumor and at least 1 cm of tissue should be removed. Cancerous phyllodes tumors are often treated with mastectomy. Close follow-up with frequent breast examinations are recommended after surgery.[11813][11814] &nbsp;&nbsp;","dateModified":"2016-07-04T22:13:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":10840,"questionText":"How might phyllodes tumors of the breast be treated?","answerText":"Surgery is the main treatment for phyllodes tumors of the breast.
