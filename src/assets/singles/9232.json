Surgery may include closure of open neural tube defects shortly after birth, treatment for hydrocephalus (most often by use of a shunt), and posterior fossa decompression (creating more space for the cerebellum and relieving pressure on the spinal cord). Medical issues may involve management of neurogenic bowel and bladder, neonatal feeding difficulties, respiratory failure, and apnea.[13793]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs with any form of surgery, there are risks associated with surgery to treat Chiari malformations. Sometimes, surgery leads to no improvement or even worsening of symptoms.[13791] For example,&nbsp;if nerve injury in the spinal canal has already occurred, surgery will not reverse the damage.[13794] However, most people who have surgery have improvement of symptoms afterwards.
