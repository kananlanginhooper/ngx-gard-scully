While <em>Baylisascaris </em>can infect different types of animals,&nbsp;<em>Baylisascaris procyonis,</em> carried by&nbsp;raccoons,&nbsp;is thought to pose the greatest risk to humans because raccoons often live in close proximity to humans.[9164][9165]&nbsp;Humans can acquire the parasite by ingesting the eggs of infected raccoons. Young children are at greatest risk for <em>Baylisascaris</em> infection because they are more likely to put contaminated soil in their mouths.[9164][9165] Though rare, human infections can be severe if the parasite invades the eye (ocular larva migrans), organs (visceral larva migrans), or the brain (neural larva migrans).[9166] Symptoms of a <em>Baylisascaris </em>infection may&nbsp;include nausea, fatigue, an enlarged liver, loss of coordination, lack of muscle control, blindness, and coma.[9164] <em>Baylisascaris</em> infections cannot be spread from one person to another.[9164] No drug has been found to be completely effective against <em>Baylisascaris</em> infections in&nbsp;humans though albendazole has been used in some cases.[9164]","dateModified":"2015-06-24T18:03:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":9008,"questionText":"How might <em>Baylisascaris</em> infection be treated?","answerText":"No drug has been found to be completely effective in treating <em>Baylisascaris</em> infections in humans.[9175] Albendazole is currently considered to be the drug of choice. <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/steroids.html\" target=\"_blank\">Corticosteroids </a>may also be given to reduce inflammation.

Most reported cases&nbsp;have involved the <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002311.htm#visualContent\" target=\"_blank\">central nervous system</a>&nbsp;and/or the eye. Neural larva migrans occurs when the <em>Baylisascaris</em> parasite invades the&nbsp;central nervous system. Neural larva migrans is seen mostly in infants and young children with a history of exposure to raccoons and their feces. Initial signs may be mild but may rapidly become more severe. A variety of neurological symptoms may occur&nbsp;including <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000680.htm\" target=\"_blank\">meningitis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/encephalitis.html\" target=\"_blank\">encephalitis</a>, loss of coordination, seizures, coma, and&nbsp;blindness. Several cases of neural larva migrans have been fatal, and many patients have been left with neurological impairment despite treatment. However, a few cases with better outcomes, including one apparent full recovery in a child with mild symptoms, have been reported. Ocular larva migrans (when the <em>Baylisascaris</em> parasite invades the eye) has been reported more frequently than neural larva migrans. Ocular larva migrans without neurological symptoms is usually reported in otherwise healthy adults with no history of exposure to raccoons.
