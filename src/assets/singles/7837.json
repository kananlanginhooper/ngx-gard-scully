These enzymes are responsible for removing ammonia from the blood stream. The urea cycle involves a series of biochemical steps in which nitrogen, a waste product of protein metabolism,&nbsp;is&nbsp;changed to a compound called urea and removed from the blood. Normally, the urea is removed from the body through the urine. In urea cycle disorders, nitrogen&nbsp;builds up in the blood&nbsp;in the form of ammonia, a highly toxic substance, resulting in <a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1174503-overview\" target=_blank>hyperammonemia</a> (elevated blood ammonia). Ammonia then reaches the brain through the blood, where it can cause irreversible brain damage, coma and/or death. The onset and severity of urea cycle disorders is highly variable.&nbsp;The severity&nbsp;correlates with the amount of urea cycle enzyme function.[6174] ","dateModified":"2013-09-10T14:45:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":5840,"relatedDiseaseName":"Arginase deficiency","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":5843,"relatedDiseaseName":"Argininosuccinic aciduria","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":7269,"relatedDiseaseName":"Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 deficiency","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":6114,"relatedDiseaseName":"Citrullinemia type I","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":10215,"relatedDiseaseName":"Citrullinemia type II","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":7158,"relatedDiseaseName":"N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":8391,"relatedDiseaseName":"Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":2830,"relatedDiseaseName":"Ornithine translocase deficiency syndrome","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
