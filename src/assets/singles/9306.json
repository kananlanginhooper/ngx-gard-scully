The condition can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary based on the size and location of the tumor and how quickly the tumor is growing. Common features include difficulty walking; loss of the ability to move one side of the body or face; vision or hearing problems; headaches (particularly in the morning); nausea and vomiting; unusual sleepiness; and behavioral changes. In most cases, the underlying cause of childhood brain stem glioma is unknown. Certain genetic conditions, such as <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/7866/neurofibromatosis-type-1/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">neurofibromatosis type I</a>, are associated with an increased risk of childhood brainstem glioma.
