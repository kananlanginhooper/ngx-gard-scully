GRACILE stands for growth retardation, aminoaciduria, cholestasis, iron overload, lactacidosis, and early death. Infants are very small at birth and quickly develop life-threatening complications. During the first days of life, infants will develop a buildup of lactic acid in the bloodstream (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000391.htm\" target=\"_blank\">lactic acidosis</a>) and amino acids in the urine (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003366.htm\" target=\"_blank\">aminoaciduria</a>). They will also have problems with the flow of bile from the liver (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000215.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cholestasis</a>) and too much iron in their blood. Affected individuals aren&rsquo;t typically born with unique physical features. Although <a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/242975-treatment\" target=\"_blank\">alkali therapy</a> is used as treatment, about half of affected infants do not survive past the first days of life. Those that do survive this period generally do not live past 4 months despite receiving treatment. GRACILE syndrome is caused by a mutation in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/BCS1L\" target=\"_blank\">BCS1L</a> gene, and it is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> pattern. The BCS1L gene provides instructions needed by the mitochondria in cells to help&nbsp;produce energy.[5348]</span>","dateModified":"2012-07-23T17:07:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
