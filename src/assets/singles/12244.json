SE describes a state in which a person has one prolonged seizure or a cluster of seizures without recovery time in between the seizures. When the cause of SE cannot initially be identified and it cannot be controlled with standard anti-seizure medicine (refractory), the condition is called NORSE.[7818][14869][14870] SE leads to a comatose state, either directly due to the seizure activity or due to anesthesia therapy  used try to stop the seizure activity. In NORSE, SE may last days, weeks, or months.[7818][14869] NORSE can affect people of all ages, but is more common in young adults and children.[7818][14869][14870]<strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n</strong>After initial testing fails to find a cause for the refractory SE, more extensive testing is performed. In just under half of the cases of NORSE, a probable or possible cause is eventually found. When the cause cannot be found, cryptogenic NORSE is diagnosed. Cryptogenic is the medical term for unknown cause. In many cases of cryptogenic NORSE, the person had a fever between 24 hours and two weeks before seizures began. These cases are classified as a sub-type of NORSE\r\ncalled <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/11005/febrile-infection-related-epilepsy-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome</a> (FIRES). Despite the fever, no known infection has been found to cause FIRES, and  the fever may or may not be present when the seizures begin. There is currently no evidence that cryptogenic NORSE, including FIRES, is hereditary.[7818][14869][14870]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf an underlying cause for NORSE is found, the treatment depends on the cause. There is no standard treatment for cryptogenic NORSE, including FIRES. Cryptogenic NORSE does not respond to standard treatment of SE and requires additional treatment with other anti-seizure medicines and/or <a href=\"http://www.asahq.org/lifeline/anesthesia%20topics/medically%20induced%20coma%20and%20sedation\" target=\"_blank\">medically inducing a coma</a> using anesthesia to control seizures.[7818][14869][14870] Anesthesia therapy may not be completely effective in stopping seizure activity (super-refractory SE).[7818][14869][14922]  NORSE can cause significant brain damage and between 20-30% of people do not survive.[7818][14869] In some cases, people with NORSE have made a full recovery, but in most cases survivors will have life long epilepsy as well as mental and physical disabilities.[7818][14869][14870]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf note, FIRES previously was considered a separate condition that occurred only in children, while NORSE was described only in adults. However, FIRES is now considered a sub-type of cryptogenic NORSE (distinguished only by a preceding fever), and both can apply to people of any age.[7818][14869][14922]","dateModified":"2018-09-06T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":7860,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE)?","answerText":"The majority of people with cryptogenic new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) develop a mild fever and symptoms of a viral illness (such as a cold or stomach flu) a day to two weeks before seizures begin and are classified as having <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/11005/febrile-infection-related-epilepsy-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">FIRES</a>, a sub-type of cryptogenic NORSE.[7818][14869][14870][14922] The fever may or may not be present when the seizures begin.[7818][14869][14922] In some cases, a person may experience behavioral changes, difficulty thinking clearly, hallucinations, or headaches before seizures begin. In other cases there are no noticeable symptoms before seizure activity.[7818] &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe seizures that begin in people with NORSE are typically either&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-seizures/focal-onset-impaired-awareness-seizures-aka-complex-partial-seizures\" target=\"_blank\">focal impaired awareness seizures</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-seizures/tonic-clonic-seizures\" target=\"_blank\">tonic-clonic seizures</a>&nbsp;(more commonly known as grand mal seizures).[7818] The seizures become very prolonged or frequent over time and transition to <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/challenges-epilepsy/seizure-emergencies/status-epilepticus\" target=\"_blank\">status epilepticus</a>&nbsp;(SE) over a few days. SE may consist of one long seizure or a cluster of seizures presenting one right after the other (no periods of normal brain activity between seizures). SE causes progressive loss of consciousness and is not controlled by anti-seizure medications (refractory SE). The seizure activity may continue or begin again during anesthesia therapy, or may begin again after being weaned off anesthesia therapy (super-refractory SE).[7818][14869][14922] In people with cryptogenic NORSE, SE lasts for days, weeks, or even several months (prolonged SE) before it finally stops or is able to be controlled with treatment. The prolonged, refractory/super-refractory SE is often referred to as the acute phase of cryptogenic NORSE/FIRES.[7818][14869] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nComplications associated with anesthesia therapy, including complications associated with being on&nbsp;a \"breathing machine\" (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000458.htm\" target=\"_blank\">mechanical ventilation</a>) and extended unconsciousness (coma), may develop and can be fatal.[7818][14870] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the duration of SE varies from person to person, it eventually does stop and consciousness is regained.
