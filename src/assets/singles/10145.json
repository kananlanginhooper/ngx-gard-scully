People with this duplication often have some degree of developmental delay (primarily speech delay), low muscle tone, poor feeding, and failure to thrive during infancy. In addition, many individuals display some behaviors commonly associated with autism spectrum disorders. Some people with PTLS have a heart defect. While most cases of PTLS occur sporadically, in rare cases, it may be inherited. Treatment involves physical, occupational, and speech therapy, and/or medical or surgical treatment for heart defects.[7110][7111]","dateModified":"2017-08-16T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":12123,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Potocki-Lupski syndrome?","answerText":"The symptoms and severity of PTLS vary from person to person.
