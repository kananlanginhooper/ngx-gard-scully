It is characterized by erratic electrical activity in the heart's upper chambers (the atria), causing an irregular response in the heart's lower chambers (the ventricles). This causes a fast and irregular heartbeat (<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001101.htm\" target=\"_blank\">arrhythmia</a>). Signs and symptoms may include dizziness, chest pain, <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-palpitations/basics/definition/con-20034780\" target=\"_blank\">palpitations</a>, shortness of breath, or fainting. Affected people also have an increased risk of stroke and sudden death. While complications may occur at any age,  some affected people never have associated health problems.[9968] Familial atrial fibrillation may be caused by changes (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>) in any of various genes, some of which have not been identified. It is most often inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner, but <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> inheritance has been reported.[9969]","dateModified":"2015-11-09T09:48:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":9652,"questionText":"How might familial atrial fibrillation be treated?","answerText":"We are unaware of treatment recommendations specific to familial atrial fibrillation, but there is information available about treatment for atrial fibrillation in general.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment for atrial fibrillation depends on the frequency and severity of symptoms and may involve medications, medical procedures, and lifestyle changes. People who don't have symptoms or related heart problems may not need treatment. The main goals of treatment include:[9972]\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Preventing blot clots and lowering risk of stroke</strong>. This may involve blood-thinning medications such as warfarin, dabigatran, heparin, and aspirin.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Controlling the rate of contractions of the ventricles (rate control)</strong>. This may involve medications to restore the heart rate to a normal level, such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digitalis.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Restoring a normal heart rhythm (rhythm control)</strong>. This is typically for people who don't do well with rate control treatment, or for people who recently began having symptoms.

The main risks in affected people are stroke and heart failure.[9984] AF is also associated with an increased risk of a first myocardial infarction (heart attack).[9979]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany people with familial AF are said to have 'lone AF' - a term that describes AF in people younger than age 60 with no underlying heart disease. The prognosis is reportedly very good in people with lone AF.[9985] However, other cardiovascular risk factors, such as age, diabetes, hypertension, and prior stroke, can further increase the risk of stroke.[9980]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther complications that may be associated with AF include adverse <a href=\"http://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/heart/diagnostics-testing/nuclear-imaging/hemodynamic-test\" target=\"_blank\">hemodynamics</a>, reduced exercise tolerance, degraded quality of life, impaired cognition or dementia, and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.[9983]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGenerally, while there is conflicting evidence in younger people with no underlying heart abnormalities, AF is associated with reduced life expectancy in older affected people.
