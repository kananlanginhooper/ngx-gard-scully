The only clinical abnormalities are mild increase of the liver size (hepatomegaly) and chronic elevation of the <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/elevated-liver-enzymes/basics/definition/sym-20050830\" target=\"_blank\">transaminase levels</a> in the blood without liver disease. Methionine may also be increased in urine. However, because elevated levels of methionine in the blood itself is a risk factor for development of neurological signs and symptoms, people with GNMT deficiency can have neurological problems when methionine levels&nbsp;are greater than 800&nbsp;&mu;mol/L.

However, to date, only five individuals from four families have been diagnosed, four of whom have been described in detail. The fact that three of the individuals 18, 15 and 17&nbsp;years after diagnosis are still well suggests that this is a benign disorder in humans. However, because highly elevated levels of methionine in the blood itself is a risk factor for development of neurological signs and symptoms, people with GNMT deficiency can have methionine levels in the range which has been shown to be associated with clinical problems.[12690][12705][12706]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBased on the findings in the five diagnosed individuals, characteristics of GNMT deficiency are mild to moderate fluctuating elevations of aminotransferases and lack of clinical symptoms&mdash;the only clinical sign present in two individuals (siblings) being mild increase in the size of the liver (hepatomegaly).

It is important, however, to have a careful follow-up. A low methionine diet (300&nbsp;mg/day) can correct the biochemical abnormalities.
