In several cases, autosomal dominant inheritance has been suspected. Currently, there are no genes associated with this condition.","Disease__c":"Odontoma dysphagia syndrome","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C1834013","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
