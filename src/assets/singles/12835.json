The signs and symptoms generally develop and progress rapidly. In the early stages of the condition, affected people may experience upper respiratory and/or viral-like symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and fever. This is followed by the rapid onset of respiratory failure and the need for <a href=\"http://www.aast.org/GeneralInformation/mechanicalventilation.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">mechanical ventilation</a> in the majority of cases. The underlying cause of AIP is unknown. Most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. There is, unfortunately, no proven treatment for AIP. Supportive care is generally recommended to address the signs and symptoms of the condition. <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/steroids.html\" target=\"_blank\">Glucocorticoid therapy</a> and other immunosuppressive therapies are often used; however, the benefits of these treatments remain unclear.[133607][13608]","dateModified":"2017-07-22T15:18:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":13337,"relatedDiseaseName":"Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
