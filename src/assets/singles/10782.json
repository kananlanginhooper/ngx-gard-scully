This may be because they inherited the genetic change from a parent, but the parent has mild symptoms of the syndrome and was never diagnosed. Most people who have an autosomal dominant form of Stickler syndrome inherited the genetic change from a parent.[3405] In other cases, the genetic change may be new in the person who was diagnosed with Stickler syndrome.
