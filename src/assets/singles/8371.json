Pneumoconiosis is caused by accumulation of inhaled particles and involves a reaction of tissue in the lung.[1509] In&nbsp;the case of baritosis, the inhaled particles are made up of barium sulfate and is well described in workers who crush and grind compounds containing barium, a mineral found in paints, paper, ceramics, glass, rubber, electronic components, and in drilling muds in oil and gas exploration.[1509] [1510]&nbsp; Baritosis is typically characterized by a mixture of very fine punctate and annular (ring-like) lesions and some slightly larger nodular lesions in the lung. The condition generally appears 1 to 2 years after exposure, does not affect the function of the lung, and appears to go away without treatment after exposure stops.[1510]","dateModified":"2016-11-14T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12753,"relatedDiseaseName":"Pneumoconiosis","relation":"Parent","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":false}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
