These deposits eventually cause widespread damage to the alveoli and surrounding lung tissue (interstitial lung disease). People with this disorder may also develop a persistent cough and difficulty breathing (dyspnea), especially during physical exertion. Chest pain that worsens when coughing, sneezing, or taking deep breaths is another common feature. People with pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis&nbsp;may also develop calcium phosphate deposits in other organs and tissue of the body.[9127] Though the &nbsp;course of the disease can be variable,&nbsp;many cases&nbsp;slowly progress to <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/pulmonaryfibrosis.html\" target=\"_blank\">lung fibrosis</a>, respiratory failure, or <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000129.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cor pulmonale</a>.[9128][9129] The only effective therapy is lung transplantation.[9128][9129] In some cases, pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is caused by mutations in the <span class=\"geneSymbol\"><em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SLC34A2\" target=\"_blank\">SLC34A2</a> </em></span>gene and inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> manner.[9127][9128]","dateModified":"2015-06-19T15:48:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
