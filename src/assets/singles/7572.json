RT involving the central nervous system (CNS) is called atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor. RT usually occurs in infancy or childhood. In most cases, the first symptoms are linked to the compressive effects of a bulky tumor (such as respiratory distress, abdominal mass, peripheral nerve palsy). In about 90% of cases it is caused by a mutation in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SMARCB1\" target=\"_blank\">SMARCB1 </a></em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SMARCB1\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a>, which is a tumor suppressor gene. In rare cases, it may be caused by a mutation in the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SMARCA4\" target=\"_blank\">SMARCA4 </a></em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SMARCA4\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a>. No standard care exists for RT, although there are many ongoing studies. Treatment includes resection of the tumor mass  and chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Because atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors and  rhabdoid tumors of the kidney have the same gene mutation and similar biopsy findings, they are now considered identical or closely related entities. Also, 10-15% of patients with malignant rhabdoid tumors have brain tumors.[8758]","dateModified":"2015-04-24T19:52:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":8758,"authors":"Geller JI","articleTitle":"Malignant Rhabdoid Tumor","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"December 5, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/993084-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
