The heart muscle also has difficulty contracting normally, which can lead to irregular heartbeats (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/arrhythmia.html\" target=\"_blank\">arrhythmia</a>), blood clots, or sudden death.[1874][1876] Over time, the heart becomes weaker and <a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/Hf/HF_WhatIs.html\" target=\"_blank\">heart failure</a> can occur.[1876] While the cause of dilated cardiomyopathy is often unknown (idiopathic), some cases are acquired and roughly half are inherited or familial.[1874][1876] Also, DCM can be a feature of many genetic syndromes.[12857] Familial dilated cardiomyopathy is most often inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>&nbsp;pattern.
