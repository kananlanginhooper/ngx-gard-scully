Features of UMS can be mild to severe and can vary significantly from person to person, even within the same family. The main features of UMS include upper limb defects (including abnormal or incomplete development of the fingers and forearm), underdevelopment of the mammary and apocrine glands (leading to absent breast development and the inability to produce breast milk), and various genital abnormalities. Other signs and symptoms may include hormonal deficiencies, delayed puberty (particularly in males), dental problems, short stature, and obesity. People with UMS may have distinct facial features, including a wide face tapering to a prominent chin, and a broad nose.[14476][14477]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUMS is&nbsp;caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TBX3\" target=\"_blank\">TBX3</a></em> gene and inheritance is autosomal dominant. However, not all people who have or inherit a mutation will have features of UMS. This phenomenon is called incomplete penetrance. Treatment depends on the specific symptoms and severity in each person and may include surgery to improve the function or appearance of limbs, and hormone replacement therapy if hormonal deficiencies are present.[14476][14477]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe exact prevalence of UMS is not currently known, but less than 150 cases have been reported in the medical literature to date.[14476]","dateModified":"2018-03-21T12:59:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
