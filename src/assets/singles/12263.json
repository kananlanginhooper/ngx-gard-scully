It mainly involves the lining inside of the cheeks (buccal mucosa) and tongue. It starts as a white plaque of thickened skin (hyperkeratosis) that eventually spreads and forms rough, wart-like (verrucous) lesions that may look like cauliflower. The lesions are slow-growing and progressive, and more and more difficult to control over time. The risk of becoming cancerous is high, especially, of transforming to <a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1965430-overview\">squamous cell cancer</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1101695-overview\">verrucous carcinoma</a>. It also has a high chance of coming back after treatment (high recurrence risk). The cause is unknown. In some cases, an association with <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/whatishpv.html\" target=\"_blank\">human papilloma virus</a> (HPV) infection has been noted. PVL is more common in elderly women who have had lesions of leukoplakia for many years.&nbsp; People with PVL should avoid certain factors currently known to be related to the development of oral cancer such as tobacco and alcohol.
