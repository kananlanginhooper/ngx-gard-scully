Children affected by Pearson syndrome may require frequent <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bloodtransfusionanddonation.html\" target=\"_blank\">blood transfusions</a> to help supply the body with healthy red blood cells. Pancreatic enzyme replacement may also help to replace the missing enzymes needed to digest food, or insulin injections may be necessary to treat diabetes. It is important that children affected by Pearson syndrome avoid other people who are sick with viral or bacterial infections, as these children cannot fight off illnesses as well as other children can.[4676][12416][12460] Other treatments depend on the specific symptoms presented by each person with Pearson syndrome. It may be necessary to see specialists for the liver, kidneys, heart, and pancreas. Physical or occupational therapy may be helpful, especially in children who live past infancy.[4676][12416][12417]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnfortunately, a stem cell transplant has not been shown to be helpful in curing a disease that affects many systems in the body like Pearson syndrome does.

Pearson syndrome usually causes a baby to die while still an infant. If a child lives past infancy, he or she may begin to have fewer symptoms of Pearson syndrome, and the symptoms may be less severe. Many of the children who survive past age 4 go on to have symptoms of a different disease called <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/kearns-sayre-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Kearns-Sayre syndrome</a>. This disease is more likely to affect the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. Symptoms of Kearns-Sayre syndrome include weak eye muscles and difficulty coordinating movements. It is important for a child with Pearson syndrome to be monitored by their doctors for any changes in symptoms as they get older.[4676][12416][12417]<span style=\"font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\"><br />\r\n<!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br />\r\n<!--[endif]--></span>","dateModified":"2016-10-28T11:10:00","resourceClassificationName":"Prognosis","references":[{"referenceId":4676,"authors":"Rogers ZR","articleTitle":"Pearson Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"May 5 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/957186-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12416,"authors":"Farruggia P, Di Cataldo A, Pinto RM, Palmisani E, Macaluso A, Lo Valvo L, Cantarini ME, Tornesello A, Corti P, Fioredda F, Varotto S, Martire B, Moroni I, Puccio G, Russo G, Dufour C, and Pillon M","articleTitle":"Pearson Syndrome: A Retrospective Cohort Study from the Marrow Failure Study Group of A.I.E.O.P.
