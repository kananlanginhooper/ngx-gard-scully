Early symptoms include poor muscle tone, poor feeding, seizures, and a gradual loss of skills. HIBCH deficiency can cause signs and symptoms similar to another disease, called <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6877/leigh-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Leigh syndrome</a>.[13074] Diagnosis is aided by blood tests which show high levels of lactic acid, and imaging studies which show changes in the \"globi pallidi\" structure of the brain.[13073][13074] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHIBCH deficiency occurs when a person inherits a mutation in both copies of their <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HIBCH\" target=\"_blank\">HIBCH</a>&nbsp;</em>gene. This pattern of inheritance is called \"autosomal recessive.\"[13073] The HIBCH gene tells the body how to make an enzyme called 3-hyroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase.

This leads to a build up of toxic valine metabolites within the&nbsp;mitochondria in the body's cells.[2] Valine is an essential amino acid, which means that it cannot be made by the body, but instead must be obtained from diet.[3] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nValine catabolism involves several steps with different enzymes acting in each step. The 3-hydroxy-isobutyryl-CoA hydrolase (HIBCH) is a mitochondrial enzyme that acts in the 5<sup>th</sup> step, therefore all the substances that are produced before this step build-up. <span>One of the metabolites, known as methacrylyl-CoA, can react with other mitochondrial enzymes and disrupt their activities.&nbsp; As a result,<strong> </strong>patients with</span><span> </span><span>HIBCH deficiency have features similar to Leigh disease and other mitochondrial disorders.[13073][13074][13079]</span><br />\r\n<span><br />\r\nHIBCH deficiency is considered an organic acidemia.&nbsp;Organic acidemias are so named because they disrupt amino acid\r\nmetabolism. This causes an increase in organic acid levels. In  HIBCH deficiency we see an increase in lactic acid. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHIBCH deficiency can also be considered a mitochondrial disease, because it  disrupts mitochondrial enzymes. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe involvement of the&nbsp;globi pallidi  in HIBCH deficiency is one of the main features of the disease. The&nbsp;globi pallidi is part of the basal ganglia in the brain. The reason that the globi pallidi is affected may be due to a failure in providing energy to the brain which results in the early death of brain cells.

Propionate is a substance produced by the break down of some aminoacids.
