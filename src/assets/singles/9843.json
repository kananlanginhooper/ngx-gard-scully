This leads to an increased volume of red blood cells compared to the total blood volume (erythrocytosis). It may also lead to increased total blood volume or increased blood thickness (hyperviscosity), both of which can cause symptoms. The disease is present at birth, but symptoms (if they develop) may arise any time during childhood or adulthood. Possible symptoms may include headaches, dizziness, fatigue, nosebleeds, difficulty breathing after physical activity, muscle pain, a reddish complexion, and altered mental status. Some people develop blood clots that can block various blood vessels, preventing adequate blood flow (thromboembolic events). Most people have mild symptoms, but some people experience life-threatening complications such as heart attack or stroke.[14304][14308] The risk of <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/hematology_and_blood_disorders/thrombosis_85,P00105\" target=\"_blank\">thrombosis</a> and severe complications increases with age.[14308]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPFCP is diagnosed by blood tests detecting isolated erythrocytosis and low <a href=\"https://labtestsonline.org/tests/erythropoietin\" target=\"_blank\">EPO levels</a>, in the absence of spleen abnormalities and other underlying diseases that can cause erythrocytosis (such as certain blood diseases and blood cancers).[14304][14308]<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nPFCP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but some people with PFCP have no relatives with the disease. In about 12-15% of people with PFCP, it is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/EPOR\" target=\"_blank\">EPOR</a></em> gene. However in most people, the genetic cause is not yet known.[14304][14308][14309]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost people with PFCP do not need ongoing treatment. Some people with high blood volume need to have blood drawn periodically (phlebotomy) to treat symptoms or to maintain close-to-normal <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/labtests/hematocrittest.html\" target=\"_blank\">hematocrit levels</a>. Some people with PFCP need medicines to lower blood pressure (antihypertensive therapy).[14304]","dateModified":"2018-01-30T12:06:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
