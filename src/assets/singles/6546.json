Localized GA  is the most common form of GA (75% of the cases) and usually affects  the forearms, hands, or feet. The generalized form of GA (15% of cases) presents with numerous erythematous papules that form larger, slightly raised patches (plaques) anywhere on the body, including the palms of hands and soles of feet. The plaques may or may not be in the ring pattern and can vary in color. Less common forms of GA include subcutaneous, perforating, and patch variants.[14853][13994][15062][15063]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe underlying cause of GA is unknown, but there are several factors that may trigger the disorder, including injury to the skin, viral infections, and certain medications and medical diseases. However, most cases of GA develop in healthy people.[11745][14853][13994][15062][15064] Some researchers propose unknown genetic factors may increase a person's risk to develop GA.[13994][15063] Diagnosis of GA is made by the appearance of skin lesions and lack of other physical findings or symptoms. GA may be confirmed by a biopsy and tests may be performed to rule out other associated diseases.[11745][13994] GA usually goes away without treatment within a few weeks to several years. However GA can sometimes last for decades, especially the generalized form. Steroids creams or injections and other therapies may be used to clear the rash more quickly, but are not successful in all cases, especially for those with the generalized form. Even after GA completely goes away, it may develop again.[11745][13994][15062][15064]<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2018-08-02T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":1083,"questionText":"What signs and symptoms are associated with granuloma annulare?","answerText":"Signs&nbsp;of&nbsp;granuloma annulare (GA) vary depending on the specific form:[11745][14853][13994][15062][15063]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Localized GA presents with small, skin-colored or reddish firm bumps (erythematous papules) on the back of arms, wrists, ankles, hands, and feet. The bumps are usually, but not always, arranged in a circular or ring pattern. Involvement of the palms of the hands, face, scalp, and genitals is rare. Lesions of localized GA typically grow slowly, and in about 50% of the cases there is more than one lesion.  </li>\r\n    <li>Generalized GA may present as widespread bumps (papules), multiple ring shaped, raised patches (plaques), and/or large discolored, oddly shaped plaques. The color of the papules and plaques may be skin color, yellow, reddish pink, or violet and may cause itching.[13994] The sizes of the plaques may range from millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. The lesions of generalized GA can form anywhere on the body, but are most common on the trunk, arms, and legs. Generalized GA can affect the neck, face, scalp, soles of feet, and palms of hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Subcutaneous GA presents with painless, round, firm lumps (nodules) that develop under the skin on the knees, ankles, feet, hands, scalp, eyelids, and/or buttocks. There can be one lump or a cluster of lumps. The lumps are usually less than 4 cm in size. The skin over the lumps may be skin colored, pink, or red, but otherwise normal in appearance. In some cases, the lumps of subcutaneous GA may grow quickly.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Perforating GA presents with small bumps with crusted centers (umbilicated papules) that may leak fluid, itch, and be painful. The bumps may feel scaly and become filled with pus or ulcerate. This rare form usually affects the hands and fingers. However perforated GA may develop anywhere on the body, especially in scars. A person may have a few bumps or many bumps that join together to form raised patches of skin (plaques). This is the only type of GA that usually leaves scars when it heals.</li>\r\n    <li>Patch GA presents with patch-like lesions that may be localized or generalized and are most commonly located in the legs or arms.&nbsp; The patches may be red, reddish brown, or violet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nChildren tend to get the localized and subcutaneous types of granuloma annulare.

Information about treatment options is available only through published reports from individual cases, a small number of cases, or small uncontrolled studies.[13994][15062]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe localized form of GA may be treated with topical steroid creams, topical <a href=\"https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/calcineurin-inhibitors/\" target=\"_blank\">tacrolimus or pimecrolimus</a>,&nbsp; freezing the lesions (cryotherapy), or laser therapy. Injecting <a href=\"https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=9c798561-a746-4176-80b3-94e5f1210271\" target=\"_blank\">triamcinolone acetonide</a>, a type of steroid, into lesions has also been successful in some cases.

Again, the first treatment is usually topical steroid cream or steroid injections into the lesions. These treatments work best before the lesions are very widespread. Predinsone taken orally (systemic steroid treatment) may also be effective early in the treatment of generalized GA, but the lesions may return when the steroid treatment is stopped.
