The most distinctive clinical feature is a calcification (hardening) of the outer ear. Other findings include characteristic facial features, a large head (macrocephaly), and intellectual disability. A variety of neurological signs such as brain calcifications, autism, and behavioral abnormalities have been reported in some cases. Additional features such as diabetes, sparse body hair, and muscle wasting become apparent in adulthood.
