This condition can be isolated to one vein, but often affects multiple veins. Stenosis occurs when there is an abnormal thickening and narrowing of the walls of the veins. Pulmonary vein stenosis is a progressive condition and may lead to total obstruction to a blood vessel.&nbsp;Most commonly, all of the pulmonary veins of one lung are affected, causing <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/pulmonaryhypertension.html\" target=_blank>pulmonary hypertension</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.lungusa.org/lung-disease/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension/\" target=_blank>pulmonary arterial hypertension</a>.&nbsp;Surgery and catheterization to widen the narrow veins is usually a short-term solution since the obstruction typically recurs.[4217][4218]","dateModified":"2011-09-01T11:15:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
