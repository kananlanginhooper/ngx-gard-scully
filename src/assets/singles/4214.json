Accumulation results in the abnormal widening (dilation) of spaces in the brain called ventricles. This can create harmful pressure on the tissues of the brain.[5677] The brain can accommodate ventricular dilatation to a certain extent without significant neuronal damage,&nbsp;but as the process continues, irreversible brain damage can occur.[5678]<br><br>The effects of hydrocephalus can be difficult to predict and partially depend on the severity, timeliness of the diagnosis and the success of treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment improves the chance of a good recovery, but the degree to which relief of CSF pressure after treatment can minimize or reverse damage is not well understood. Hydrocephalus causes risks to cognitive and physical development, but many affected individuals benefit from rehabilitation and educational intervention, leading lives with few limitations. If hydrocephalus is left untreated, it may be fatal.[5677]<br><br>In general, there is a greater chance for an abnormal outcome with fetal hydrocephalus (present in utero)&nbsp;compared to neonatal hydrocephalus&nbsp;(beginning&nbsp;shortly after birth)&nbsp;because of the period it is left untreated in utero. Prenatal factors such as progression, degree of cortical mantle thinning to less than 1.5 cm, and in-utero duration of greater than four weeks are associated with a poorer prognosis.[5678]","dateModified":"2012-12-11T10:15:00","references":[{"referenceId":5677,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Hydrocephalus Fact Sheet","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"NINDS","date":"July 27, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/hydrocephalus/detail_hydrocephalus.htm","dateAccessed":"2015-12-16T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":5678,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Hydrocephalus","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia","date":"June 2011","url":"http://www.chop.edu/service/fetal-diagnosis-and-treatment/fetal-diagnoses/hydrocephalus.html","dateAccessed":"2012-12-11T00:00:00"}]}]}],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
