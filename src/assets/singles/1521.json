In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), an alteration needs to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the condition. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nX-linked recessive conditions affect males much more frequently than females. Females, who have one altered gene, are called carriers.

A male with an X-linked recessive condition cannot pass on the disorder to his sons, but all of his daughters will be carriers. Sometimes a male child is the first person in a family with Menkes disease. In this case, the gene alteration may have been inherited from the mother, or the alteration may have occurred by chance for the first time in the child (de novo).[4921]","dateModified":"2020-03-31T13:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[{"referenceId":4921,"authors":"Kaler S","articleTitle":"ATP7A-Related Copper Transport Disorders","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"Updated Aug. 18, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1413","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":9772,"questionText":"How is Menkes disease diagnosed?","answerText":"Menkes disease is typically diagnosed based on the clinical features, medical examination, and genetic testing for alterations in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ATP7A\" target=\"_blank\">ATP7A</a></em> gene.&nbsp; Other types of tests that may be helpful include analysis of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003561.htm\" target=\"_blank\">catecholamines</a> (chemicals that are sensitive to copper) and copper levels in the blood.[15452]","dateModified":"2020-03-31T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Diagnosis","references":[{"referenceId":15452,"authors":"Vairo FPE, Chwal BC, Perini S, Ferreira MAP, de Freitas Lopes AC, Saute JAM","articleTitle":"A systematic review and evidence-based guideline for diagnosis and treatment of Menkes disease","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Mol Genet Metab","date":"Jan 2019","volume":"126(1)","pages":"6-13","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30594472","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":9770,"questionText":"How might Menkes disease be treated?","answerText":"There is no specific treatment for Menkes disease (MD).
