It is named Legionnaires&rsquo; disease because it was first discovered after a pneumonia outbreak among people who attended an American Legion Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1976.[14815]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost people exposed to <em>Legionella</em> do not become sick with Legionnaires' disease.[14808] People who do become sick usually develop symptoms within 2 to 10 days after exposure, but it may take longer. The first symptoms may include headache, chills, muscle pains, and a fever that can be 104&deg;F (40&deg;C) or higher.[14814] Additional symptoms usually develop 1 to 2 days after the first symptoms and may include coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and confusion.[14814][14807] While Legionnaires&rsquo; disease mainly affects the lungs, it sometimes causes infections in other parts of the body, such as the heart or within body wounds.[14814]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA person can become infected from <em>Legionella</em> when they inhale mist or water droplets that contain the bacteria.[14814][14808] Sources of exposure may include showers, faucets, whirlpools, grocery store misters, and water droplets passing through ventilation systems in large buildings (such as hotels, office buildings, and hospitals).[14814] People who are more susceptible to developing Legionnaires' disease after an exposure include adults over age 50, current or former smokers, and people who have a weakened immune system or a chronic disease.[14814][14808] Generally, neither the bacteria nor Legionnaires' disease is spread directly from person to person.[14816][14817] While large exposures can result in outbreaks, the disease usually occurs in single, isolated cases.[14818]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLegionnaires' disease may be suspected by symptoms. Pneumonia can be confirmed by a chest X-ray. Legionnaires' disease is diagnosed when one of the species of&nbsp;<em>Legionella </em>is&nbsp;found to be the cause of the pneumonia by testing a urine sample (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003751.htm\" target=\"_blank\">urine culture</a>) or a sample of saliva and mucus that is coughed up (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003723.htm\" target=\"_blank\">sputum culture</a>).[14812] Without treatment, the disease can be fatal.[14814] People with the disease who are otherwise healthy usually recover with antibiotics, although they may need to be cared for in a hospital. About 1 in 10 people with Legionnaires&rsquo; disease will not survive due to complications such as respiratory failure, kidney failure, or septic shock.[14814][14812]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf note, <em>Legionella</em> can also cause a milder illness called <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/signs-symptoms.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pontiac fever</a>, which causes flu-like symptoms, but does not cause pneumonia. Pontiac fever typically goes away without specific treatment.[14812]","dateModified":"2018-07-19T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":13588,"relatedDiseaseName":"Pontiac fever","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
