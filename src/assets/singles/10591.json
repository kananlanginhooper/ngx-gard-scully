The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/images/PX00008K_PRESENTATION.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">duplication</a>&nbsp;occurs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a location designated q21.1.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome people with a 1q21.1 microduplication have developmental delay and intellectual disability that is typically mild to moderate. Individuals with this condition can also have features of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/autism-spectrum-disorder/\" target=\"_blank\">autism spectrum disorder</a>. These disorders are characterized by impaired communication and socialization skills, as well as delayed development of speech and language. Expressive language skills (vocabulary and the production of speech) tend to be more impaired than receptive language skills (the ability to understand speech) in affected individuals. In childhood, 1q21.1 microduplications may also be associated with an increased risk of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/\" target=\"_blank\">attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder</a>&nbsp;(ADHD) and other behavioral problems.

Rarely, recurrent seizures (epilepsy) occur in people with a 1q21.1 microduplication.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome individuals with a 1q21.1 microduplication are born with malformations of the heart, including a particular combination of heart defects known as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/images/PX0000M4_PRESENTATION.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">tetralogy of Fallot</a>. Less commonly, other physical malformations such as the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias) in males, inward- and upward-turning feet (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/images/PX0000W0_PRESENTATION.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">clubfeet</a>), or misalignment of the hip joint (hip dysplasia) are present at birth. Individuals with a 1q21.1 microduplication may also have a larger than average head size or taller than average adult stature. Some have slightly unusual facial features such as wide-set eyes or low-set ears. As adults, individuals with a 1q21.1 microduplication may be prone to develop cysts, swollen and knotted (varicose) veins, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/\" target=\"_blank\">carpal tunnel syndrome</a>, which is characterized by numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hands and fingers. However, there is no particular pattern of physical abnormalities that characterizes 1q21.1 microduplications. Signs and symptoms related to the chromosomal change vary even among affected members of the same family.

When the condition occurs sporadically, it is caused by a random error during the formation of the egg or sperm cell, or during the early days after fertilization.[6147] The duplication occurs when part of chromosome 1 is copied (duplicated) abnormally, resulting in the extra genetic material from the duplicated segment.[6148] If the condition is inherited from a parent, it means that one of the parents also has the extra piece of genetic material. In these cases, the parent with the duplication has a 50% chance with each pregnancy to pass the duplication on to his/her child. The only way to know if it has been inherited from a parent is for the parents to have genetic testing. A parent with the duplication may not have any signs or symptoms. In both cases, nothing that either parent does, or does not do, can cause this syndrome to occur.<br><br>Individuals who are interested in genetic testing for themselves or family members should speak with a genetics professional.","dateModified":"2013-08-15T12:57:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":6147,"authors":"","articleTitle":"1q21.1 Microduplications","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Unique","date":"June 2011","url":"http://www.rarechromo.org/information/Chromosome%20%201/1q21.1%20microduplications%20FTNW.pdf","dateAccessed":"2013-08-15T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":6148,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Chromosomal duplication","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"August 12, 2013","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/illustrations/chromosomalduplication","dateAccessed":"2013-08-15T00:00:00"}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":10831,"relatedDiseaseName":"1q duplications","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
