The name \"moyamoya\" means \"puff of smoke\" in Japanese and describes the look of the tangled vessels that form to compensate for the blockage. This condition usually affects children, but can affect adults.

While children usually respond better to revascularization surgery than adults, the majority of individuals have no further strokes or related problems after surgery.[7500]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo medication can stop the narrowing of the brain's blood vessels, or the development of the thin, fragile vessels that characterize the disease.[7505] However, medications are used to treat many of the symptoms of the disease, and are often an important part of the management. Medications may include aspirin (to prevent or reduce the development of small blood clots); <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/calcium-channel-blockers/art-20047605\" target=\"_blank\">calcium channel blockers</a> (which may improve symptoms of headaches and reduce symptoms related to transient ischemic attacks); and anti-seizure medications (when needed for a seizure disorder).
