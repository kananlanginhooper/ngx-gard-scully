Many people with this condition have skeletal abnormalities such as an unusually large range of joint movement (hyperextensibility), an abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis), reduced bone density (osteopenia), and a tendency for bones to fracture easily. Dental abnormalities are also common in AD-HIES. The primary (baby) teeth do not fall out at the usual time during childhood, but are retained as the adult teeth grow in.
