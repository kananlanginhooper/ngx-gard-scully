Symptoms include a sudden onset of pain, swelling, and tenderness of the cartilage of one or both ears. The <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/9528.htm\" target=\"_blank\">pinna</a> usually loses firmness and becomes floppy; hearing impairment may also occur. Inflammation of the inner ear may also cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and/or ataxia.</li>\r\n    <li><em>Joint</em>: The second most common finding is joint pain with or without <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/arthritis.html\" target=\"_blank\">arthritis</a>. </li>\r\n    <li><em>Eye</em>: Affected people may experience <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001019.htm\" target=\"_blank\">episcleritis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001005.htm\" target=\"_blank\">uveitis</a> and/or <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001003.htm\" target=\"_blank\">scleritis</a>. Scleritis may lead to a bluish or dark discoloration of the sclera (white of the eye) and may even be associated with vision loss in severe cases. Proptosis (bulging out of one or both eye balls) may also be a symptom of RP.</li>\r\n    <li><em>Nose</em>: Nasal cartilage inflammation may lead to stuffiness, crusting, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">rhinorrhea</a>, epistaxis (nose bleeds), compromised sense of smell and/or saddle nose deformity (a condition where the nose is weakened and thus \"saddled\" in the middle).</li>\r\n    <li><em>Airways</em>: Inflammation may affect the <a href=\"http://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/respiratory/passages/larynx.html\" target=\"_blank\">larynx</a>, trachea (windpipe), and bronchi (tubes that branch off the trachea and carry air to the lungs). Airway involvement may lead to a cough, wheezing, hoarseness and recurrent infections. It can become life-threatening if not properly diagnosed and managed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />\r\nLess commonly, RP may affect the heart, kidneys, nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and/or vascular (veins) system. Nonspecific symptoms such as fever, weight loss, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003089.htm\" target=\"_blank\">malaise</a>, and fatigue may also be present.[8711] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn approximately one third of affected people, RP is associated with other medical problems.
