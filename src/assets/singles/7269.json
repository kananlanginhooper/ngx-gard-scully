Symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, lack of energy, low body temperature and weak muscle tone. These usually occur in the first few days of life. High levels of ammonia can lead to complications such as seizures, breathing problems, intellectual disability and coma. CPS1 deficiency is caused by alterations (mutations) in the <em>CPS1</em> gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, laboratory testing, and genetic testing. Treatment is aggressive removal of excess ammonia, a protein-limited diet and specific medications.[3106][15489][15490][15491][15492]","dateModified":"2020-04-21T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13387,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 deficiency?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 deficiency (CPS1 deficiency).
