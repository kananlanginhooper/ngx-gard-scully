If a person is born with this condition it is referred to as congenital wandering spleen. The condition is not hereditary. Acquired wandering spleen&nbsp;may occur during adulthood&nbsp;due to injuries or other underlying conditions that may weaken the ligaments that hold the spleen. Symptoms of wandering spleen may include englargement of the spleen (<a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/enlarged-spleen/basics/definition/con-20029324\" target=\"_blank\">splenomegaly</a>), abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction,&nbsp;nausea, vomiting, fever, and a lump in the abdomen or the pelvis.
