Classic signs and symptoms include congenital or early development of painless papules, nodules or plaques with spontaneous regression in 2-3 months, and increase of a type of immune cells known as Langerhans cell histiocytes. Langerhans cells help regulate the immune system, and are normally found throughout the body. An excess of immature Langerhans cells usually form tumors called granulomas. &nbsp;Most patients have multiple lesions, but in about 25% of cases there is only one lesion.[13484][13485][13488] Development of lesions in adulthood, recurrence of the disease, as well as lung and eye involvement, are very rare.[13484][13488] Because  the lesions often cure by themselves, treatment is usually not necessary, although topical corticoids may be used for persistent lesions. It is considered as a benign, self-limited disorder, but long-term follow-up and a thorough evaluation for internal organ abnormalities is recommended.[13488][13486]<br />\r\n<span><br />\r\nHashimoto-Pritzker disease is one form (congenital self-healing variant) of <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/langerhans-cell-histiocytosis\">Langerhans cell histiocytosis</a> (LCH). The other forms include a severe, acute and disseminate form known as Letterer-Siwe disease, an intermediate chronic form with multiple lesions known as Hand-Sch&uuml;ller-Christian disease (characterized by diabetes insipidus, bulging of the eye and localized lesions in the bone) and a less severe disease known as eosinophilic granuloma, characterized by</span><span> </span><span>solitary or few, and chronic lesions of bone or other organs. Because all the variants have many common symptoms it is though that they may be manifestations of Langerhans cell histiocytosis and not separate syndromes.[13484][13485] &nbsp;</span>","dateModified":"2017-06-07T18:15:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":6858,"relatedDiseaseName":"Langerhans cell histiocytosis","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
