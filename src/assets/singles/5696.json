Affected girls appear to have normal <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/psychomotor\" target=\"_blank\">psychomotor</a> development during the first 6 to 18 months of life, followed by a developmental \"plateau,\" and then rapid regression in language and motor skills. Additional signs and symptoms may include repetitive, stereotypic hand movements; fits of screaming and inconsolable crying; autistic features; panic-like attacks; teeth grinding (bruxism); episodic <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/apnea\" target=\"_blank\">apnea</a> and/or <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/hyperpnea\" target=\"_blank\">hyperpnea</a>; gait <a href=\"http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/centers_clinics/movement_disorders/ataxia/conditions/\" target=\"_blank\">ataxia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007472.htm\" target=\"_blank\">apraxia</a>; tremors; seizures; and slowed head growth. Some people have an atypical form of Rett syndrome that may be more mild or more severe. Classic Rett syndrome is most commonly caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MECP2\" target=\"_blank\">MECP2</a></em> gene and is usually inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.genetics.edu.au/Publications-and-Resources/Genetics-Fact-Sheets/FactSheet10A\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked dominant</a> manner. The vast majority of cases are not inherited from a parent, but are due to a new mutation in the affected person.

This gene provides instructions for making a protein (MeCP2) needed for the development of the nervous system and normal brain function.
