Ochronosis starts after age 30 and arthritis in early adulthood. Other features of this condition can include heart problems, kidney stones, and prostate stones.

This blue-black pigmentation usually appears after age 30 and commonly affects the cartilage of the ear, ligaments, tendons, blood vessels, kidneys, lungs and prostate. Dark spots on the white of the eye and cornea may also occur. People with alkaptonuria typically develop arthritis, particularly in the spine and large joints, beginning in early adulthood.
