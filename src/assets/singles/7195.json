These drugs are commonly prescribed for the treatment of <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000928.htm\" target=\"_blank\">schizophrenia</a> and other neurological, mental, or emotional disorders. Affected people may experience high fever, muscle stiffness, sweating, unstable blood pressure, altered mental status, and <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dysautonomia/dysautonomia.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autonomic dysfunction</a>. In most cases, the&nbsp;condition develops within the first 2 weeks of treatment with the drug; however,&nbsp;it may develop any time during the therapy period. The exact underlying cause of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is unknown. In some cases, more than one family member can be affected which suggests there may be a <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/predisposition\" target=\"_blank\">genetic component</a>. Upon diagnosis of the condition, the neuroleptic or antipsychotic drug is generally discontinued under a physician's supervision. Medications and/or other interventions may also be recommended to manage symptoms.[9302][9303][9304]","dateModified":"2015-07-14T21:13:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
