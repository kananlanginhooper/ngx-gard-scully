The nerve root is the first part of nerve leaving the spinal cord and then becomes a peripheral nerve. Schwann cells provide support by wrapping around nerves and nerve roots but also produce the fatty insulation called <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002261.htm\" target=\"_blank\">myelin</a> that surrounds nerves and helps nerve signals travel fast. When a schwannoma grows large enough, it may begin compressing or putting a squeezing pressure on the nerve. It also damages the myelin in that area of the nerve.
