This syndrome leads to developmental regression  and&nbsp;causes&nbsp;a specific pattern,&nbsp;known as&nbsp;hypsarrhythmia (chaotic brain waves), on <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003931.htm\" target=\"_blank\">electroencephalography (EEG)</a> testing. The infantile spasms usually begin in the first year of life, typically between 4-8 months. The seizures primarily consist of a sudden bending forward of the body with stiffening of the arms and legs; some children arch their backs as they extend their arms and legs. Spasms tend to occur upon awakening or after feeding, and often occur in clusters of up to 100 spasms at a time. Infants may have dozens of clusters and several hundred spasms per day. Infantile spasms usually stop by age five, but may be replaced by other types of seizures.[3165] Many  disorders leading to brain injury, such as birth problems, cerebral anomalies,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/metabolicdisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">metabolic disorders</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/geneticdisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">genetic disorders</a> can lead to these spasms, making it important to identify the underlying cause.
