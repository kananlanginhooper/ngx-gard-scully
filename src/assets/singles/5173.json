Thiopurine S-methyltransferase&nbsp;deficiency patients have&nbsp;a mutation in either one or both copies of the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TPMT\" target=_blank>TPMT</a> gene&nbsp;that causes reduced enzyme activity and difficulties breaking down thiopurine drugs.&nbsp;Affected individuals are at a high risk of&nbsp;experiencing bone marrow damage&nbsp;if they take thiopurine drugs. Many patients recover from the bone marrow damage once thiopurine drug use is stopped. However when the bone marrow is damaged, infections can cause serious health problems and may&nbsp;be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of bone marrow damage, thiopurine therapy should be lowered based on how many mutations a patient has in the TPMT gene.
