Symptoms of BRRS may include large head size, increased birth weight, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Other symptoms include the appearance of non-cancerous tumors in the digestive system, fatty tumors under the skin, and freckles on the penis. People with BRRS have an increased risk of developing breast, thyroid, and uterine cancer. This condition is part of a group of conditions known as the PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes, which all share similar features and are caused by genetic changes (<a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/776887\" target=\"_blank\">DNA variants</a>) in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PTEN\" target=\"_blank\">PTEN</a></em> gene.
