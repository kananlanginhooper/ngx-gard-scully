Symptoms include pain, weakness, bowel and bladder problems, and temporary vision loss. NMOSD usually occurs in adulthood, but symptoms may start at any age. Some people have a single attack of symptoms lasting months, but in most people the symptoms come and go over time. People with NMOSD may develop permanent muscle weakness and vision loss. The cause of NMOSD is unknown. It occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells&nbsp;in the spinal cord and eyes. It can be diagnosed by a clinical exam, MRI looking for specific signs, and blood tests looking for certain antibodies. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms and preventing relapses.[15672][15673][15674][15675]<br />","dateModified":"2020-06-18T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":8002,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD).
