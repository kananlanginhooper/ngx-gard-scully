People affected by this condition often have a blood abnormality called monoclonal gammopathy, a condition in which the body over-produces certain immunoglobulins (typically immunoglobulin M). Immunoglobulins are proteins that are made by certain white blood cells. They play a role in the <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000821.htm\" target=\"_blank\">immune response</a> by helping destroy bacteria, viruses, and other substances that appear foreign and harmful. Some researchers believe that the abnormal accumulation of immunoglobulins in the skin and other parts of the body may play a role in the development of the signs and symptoms of Schnitzler syndrome.[9552][9553]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther scientists speculate that alterations in cytokines may play a role in the development of Schnitzler syndrome. Cytokines are specialized proteins that play an important role in the immune response. They are secreted by certain immune system cells and play a vital role in controlling the growth and activity of other immune system cells. Abnormal findings involving a specific cytokine called interleukin-1 have been found in some people with Schnitzler syndrome.[9553][9554][9552]","dateModified":"2015-08-27T15:53:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":9552,"authors":"Joel G DeKoven, MD, MHSc, FRCPC","articleTitle":"Schnitzler Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"April 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1050761-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9553,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Schnitzler Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Organization for Rare Disorders","date":"2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/schnitzler-syndrome/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9554,"authors":"Paul Jarrett, MD","articleTitle":"Schnitzler syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"DermNet NZ","date":"May 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.dermnetnz.org/systemic/schnitzler.html","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":9332,"questionText":"How is Schnitzler syndrome diagnosed?","answerText":"A diagnosis of Schnitzler syndrome is often suspected based on the presence of characteristic <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/12390/schnitzler-syndrome/resources/9\" target=\"_blank\">signs and symptoms</a> identified through physical exam, laboratory studies (i.e. <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003541.htm\" target=\"_blank\">immunoelectrophoresis</a>) and/or imaging studies.
