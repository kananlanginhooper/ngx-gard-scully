The amount of hearing loss varies among affected people. In many cases, significant hearing loss is present at birth. In other cases, hearing loss does not develop until later in infancy or childhood. Some people have problems with balance caused by dysfunction of the part of the inner ear that helps with balance and orientation (the vestibular system). Pendred syndrome is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> manner. <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">Mutations</a> in 3 genes are currently known to cause the condition (<em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SLC26A4\" target=\"_blank\">SLC26A4</a></em>, <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FOXI1\" target=\"_blank\">FOXI1</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/KCNJ10\" target=\"_blank\">KCNJ10</a></em>) and are found in about half of affected people.
