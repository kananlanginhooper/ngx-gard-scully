The diabetes in MIDD is characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin, which regulates the amount of sugar in the blood. MIDD is caused by mutations in the <span class=\"geneSymbol\"><em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MT-TL1\" target=\"_blank\">MT-TL1</a></em></span>, <span class=\"geneSymbol\"><em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MT-TK\" target=\"_blank\">MT-TK</a></em></span>, or <span class=\"geneSymbol\"><em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MT-TE\" target=\"_blank\">MT-TE</a></em></span> gene. These genes are found in mitochondrial DNA, which is part of cellular structures called mitochondria. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the cell nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA). Because the genes involved with MIDD are found in mitochondrial DNA, this condition is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as maternal inheritance. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, only females pass mitochondrial conditions to their children. Mitochondrial disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass mitochondrial traits to their children.[7201]","dateModified":"2014-02-20T14:29:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":7320,"questionText":"When do the diabetes and hearing loss associated with MIDD typically develop?","answerText":"In MIDD, the diabetes and hearing loss usually develop in mid-adulthood, although the age that they occur varies from childhood to late adulthood.
