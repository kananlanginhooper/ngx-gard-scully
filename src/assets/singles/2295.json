Certain molecules (antigens) on the surface of the baby's platelets are recognized as foreign by the mother's immune system. The mother&rsquo;s immune system then creates antibodies that attack and destroy the baby&rsquo;s platelets.[13914][13915][13916][13917] Though NAIT can occur whenever the mother&rsquo;s blood mixes with that of the baby, it is usually triggered when the mother is exposed to the baby&rsquo;s blood during delivery. Many cases of NAIT are mild. Signs and symptoms may include a low platelet count (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000586.htm\" target=\"_blank\">thrombocytopenia</a>) and signs of bleeding into the skin such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003235.htm\" target=\"_blank\">petechiae and purpura</a>. In the most severe cases, NAIT can cause bleeding episodes that may result in death or long-term disability. Bleeding episodes can occur either during pregnancy or after birth.[13916] Management of the infant with neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia may include platelet transfusions, ultrasounds, and <a href=\"https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/intravenous-immunoglobulin/\" target=\"_blank\">intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)</a>. Treatment for pregnant mothers at risk for NAIT may include IVIG and<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/steroids.html\" target=\"_blank\"> steroids</a>.[13916]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2017-10-09T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":12285,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia?","answerText":"Some cases of NAIT are mild.[13915] The most common sign is bleeding into the skin which may present as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003235.htm\" target=\"_blank\">petechiae or localized swellings</a> (hematomas).
