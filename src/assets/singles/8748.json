People with this disease have increased bone density, particularly affecting the long bones of the arms and legs. In some cases, the skull and hip bones are also affected. The thickened bones can lead to pain in the arms and legs, a waddling walk, muscle weakness, and extreme tiredness. The age that symptoms begin varies greatly, but most people with this condition develop pain or weakness by adolescence.[376] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCamurati-Engelmann disease is caused by a mutation in the <a class=\"link-dapple\" title=\"T G F B 1\" href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene=tgfb1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>TGFB1</em></a> gene and inheritance is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>.[376][377] In some cases, people have the gene mutation that causes Camurati-Engelmann disease but they never develop symptoms.[376] In others, symptoms are present, but a gene mutation cannot be found.
