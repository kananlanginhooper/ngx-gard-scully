Females with tetrasomy X have a total of 48 chromosomes in their cells, so this condition is sometimes written as 48, XXXX.

However, errors in cell division can cause an egg cell to have three or four X chromosomes, instead of one. If an egg cell with the extra X chromosomes is fertilized by a sperm cell with one X chromosome, the resulting embryo will have these extra chromosomes.

Much of the information available is based on women with a previous pregnancy affected by a trisomy (3 copies of a chromosome), which is much more common than a tetrasomy. However, the recurrence risk for numerical sex chromosome abnormalities in general (extra or missing X or Y chromosomes) is thought to be very low.[7196]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main factor known to increase a person's risk to have a baby with an abnormal number of chromosomes is maternal age. Women are born with all the eggs they will ever have. As a woman ages, so do her eggs. Errors may develop in the genetic material of eggs over time. Because of this, as a woman's age increases, the risk to have a baby with a chromosome abnormality increases.[7195]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople with specific questions about recurrence risks for themselves or family members should speak with a genetics professional.","dateModified":"2014-02-19T15:29:00","references":[{"referenceId":7195,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Chromosome abnormalities","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"NHGRI","date":"February 12, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.genome.gov/11508982","dateAccessed":"2014-02-19T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":7196,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Chromosomal conditions","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics in Family Medicine: The Australian Handbook for General Practitioners","date":"2007","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/your_health/egenetics/practioners/gems/sections/07_chromosomal_conditions.pdf","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":7317,"questionText":"Can a person have a test for chromosome abnormalities during pregnancy?","answerText":"Yes.
