Eventually, most people with LGMD2B require a wheelchair, but this may be years after the diagnosis. Muscle weakness affecting the heart muscles or muscles necessary for breathing is uncommon in people with LGMD2B. In rare cases, the progression of the disease may be more rapid, with people requiring a wheelchair in one or two years after symptoms begin.[10984]","dateModified":"2017-12-26T17:50:00","resourceClassificationName":"Prognosis","references":[{"referenceId":10984,"authors":"Pegoraro E and Hoffman EP","articleTitle":"Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Overview","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"August 30, 2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1408/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":2003,"relatedDiseaseName":"Dysferlinopathy","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":6907,"relatedDiseaseName":"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[{"caseId":55792,"abbreviatedInquiry":"I wanted to know if this type is always recessive, or can it also be dominant in some cases?
