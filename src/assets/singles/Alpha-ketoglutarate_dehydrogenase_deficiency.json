Metabolic acidosis, elevated lactate and glutamate levels and variable degrees of glutaric aciduria are noted. Sudden death, myocardiopathy, and hepatic disorders have also been reported in some cases.","Disease__c":"Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase deficiency","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C2752074","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
