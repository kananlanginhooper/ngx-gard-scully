Treatment of the condition is then typically&nbsp;directed toward the specific symptoms that the affected individual has. Some individuals may need surgical removal of histiocytic lesions.[4797] In more serious cases, treatment options have included therapy with certain drugs including steroids (e.g., prednisone), alfa-interferon (a man-made copy of a protein that is normally made by the body in response to infection), chemotherapy and radiation therapy.[1254][4797] These treatments have improved symptoms in some individuals, but in others they have not been effective.
