Patients with ADTKD-UMOD have high blood levels of uric acid before kidney failure develops, and some affected individuals may develop gout. <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/gout.html\" target=\"_blank\">Gout</a> is a form of arthritis (inflammation) that occurs often in the big toe, ankle, knee, or other joints.[14423][14426][15283] ADTKD-UMOD is caused by a mistake (mutation) in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/UMOD\" target=\"_blank\">UMOD</a></em> gene, which leads to the build-up of the altered uromodulin protein in the tubules of the kidney, leading to slow loss of kidney function. ADTKD-UMOD is inherited in a dominant pattern in families.
