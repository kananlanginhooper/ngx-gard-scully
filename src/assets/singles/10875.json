Organs are expected to be in a particular orientation inside of the body, known as <a href=\"https://radiopaedia.org/articles/situs-solitus\">situs solitus</a>. Heterotaxy occurs when the organs are not in this typical orientation, but are instead in different positions in the body. This most commonly causes complications with the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and intestines. Specific symptoms include not getting enough oxygen throughout the body, breathing difficulties, increased risk for infection, and problems digesting food. Heterotaxy may be caused by genetic changes (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\">mutations</a>), exposures to toxins while a woman is pregnant causing the baby to have heterotaxy, or the condition may occur sporadically. The condition is typically diagnosed through imaging such as an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003869.htm\">echocardiogram</a> or an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003335.htm\">MRI</a>.

This can cause organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, intestines, and spleen to not work correctly. Symptoms of these organs working incorrectly may include breathing difficulties, having a bluish color to the skin (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003215.htm\">cyanosis</a>), and problems digesting food. For some people with heterotaxy, the only sign may be a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/congenitalheartdefects.html\">heart defect</a>.[4644] Others may have twisting of the intestines (<a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/930313-overview\">malrotation</a>). People with heterotaxy may have a missing spleen (<a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=17894\">asplenia</a>) or they may have a spleen that is divided into many smaller parts (<a href=\"https://radiopaedia.org/articles/polysplenia-syndrome-1\">polysplenia</a>). If the function of the spleen is affected, this can cause a reduced ability to fight infections.[13223][13224] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost people with heterotaxy are first found to have the condition shortly after birth when they have symptoms related to a heart defect. However, other individuals are not diagnosed until later in childhood or adulthood due to problems with the intestines or liver that may cause abdominal pain or vomiting.[9556] Other adults with heterotaxy are diagnosed because they were receiving imaging for other medical problems.
