People with HbSE have hemoglobin that doesn't work efficiently. Symptoms usually develop in early adulthood. They may include mild anemia, enlarged spleen, reduced blood flow to the joints, and painful episodes due to blocked blood vessels. Many people with this condition have no symptoms. HbSE is caused by genetic changes (DNA variants) in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HBB\" target=\"_blank\">HB</a></em><em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HBB\" target=\"_blank\"><em>B</em></a></em> gene that cause it to not work correctly. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This condition is diagnosed based on a clinical exam, the symptoms, and through blood tests that look for specific types of hemoglobin. Genetic testing may also be helpful. Many people with HbSE do not need treatment, while others need management of their specific symptoms.[15570][15572][15574]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2020-05-18T13:41:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13449,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Hemoglobin SE disease?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with hemoglobin SE disease.
