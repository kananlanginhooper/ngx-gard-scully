Both disorders probably result from deposits derived from <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/immunoglobulins\" target=\"_blank\">immunoglobulins</a> but in most cases the cause is idiopathic (unknown). The diagnosis is made with a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/diagnostic-tests/biopsy-kidneys/Pages/kidney-biopsy.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">kidney biopsy </a>and by <a href=\"https://www.jic.ac.uk/microscopy/intro_EM.html\" target=\"_blank\">electron microscopy</a>.&nbsp;Fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy can be differentiated from each other by electron microscopy; the fibrils in fibrillary glomerulonephritis are smaller and randomly oriented as opposed to the larger and often organized fibrils of immunotactoid glomerulopathy.  The signs and symptoms include blood (hematuria) and protein (proteinuria) in the urine, <a href=\"http://www.kidney-problem.org/renal-insufficiency.html\" target=\"_blank\">kidney insufficiency </a>and high blood pressure.    Both fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy have been associated with <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0022399/\" target=\"_blank\">hepatitis C virus </a>infection and with malignancy and autoimmune disease. Because of this, patients should be screened for these conditions.  Treatment is generally determined by the severity of the kidney problems.[7311]","dateModified":"2015-08-18T16:32:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12741,"relatedDiseaseName":"Immunotactoid or fibrillary glomerulopathy","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
