Autosomal means the gene is found on one of the numbered chromosomes found in both sexes. Dominant means that only one altered copy of a gene is necessary to have the condition. The alteration can be inherited from either parent. Sometimes an autosomal dominant condition occurs because of a new genetic alteration (de novo) and there is no history of this condition in the family. This is often the case for GAND.[15761]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach child of an individual with an autosomal dominant condition has a 50% or 1 in 2 chance of inheriting the alteration and the condition. Typically, children who inherit a dominant alteration will have the condition, but they may be more or less severely affected than their parent. Sometimes a person may have a gene alteration for an autosomal dominant condition and show no signs or symptoms of the condition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn rare cases, it may be inherited from a parent who has a genetic variant in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GATAD2B\" target=\"_blank\">GATAD2B</a></em> gene in some of his or her cells but not all of them (mosaic).
