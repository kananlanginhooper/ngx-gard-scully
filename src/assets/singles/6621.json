Treatment is usually not necessary unless severe anemia occurs. In severe cases, surgery to remove the spleen may decrease the rate of red blood cell damage.[15371] HE is generally not life-threatening.","dateModified":"2019-04-15T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13293,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of hereditary elliptocytosis?","answerText":"The symptoms of hereditary elliptocytosis may be different from person to person.&nbsp; Symptoms may appear at any age.
