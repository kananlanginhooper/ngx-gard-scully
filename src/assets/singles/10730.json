Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>25% chance to be affected</li>\r\n    <li>50% chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent</li>\r\n    <li>25% chance to be unaffected&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;not a carrier</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen a&nbsp;person with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent epilepsy (so has two copies of the changed gene) has children, the risk their child will be affected by this type of epilepsy is dependent on whether their partner has mutations in one or both of their <em>PNPO</em> genes.
