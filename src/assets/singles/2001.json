Treatment\r\nof severe anemia may involve  blood transfusions. Blood transfusions can\r\nraise iron levels so, careful monitoring and treatment\r\nfor iron overload is required. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute offers tips for living with hemolytic anemia at the following link:<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ha/livingwith\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ha/livingwith</a> <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSplenectomy is considered for\r\npeople with CDA-2 and severe anemia. Splenectomy can cause a consistent\r\nrise in hemoglobin values.[9170] The spleen, however,&nbsp;is important in&nbsp;fighting\r\ninfection.&nbsp; People,\r\nparticularly children, who have had a splenectomy are more likely to\r\ncontract a&nbsp;serious and possibly&nbsp;life-threatening infection (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000666.htm\" target=\"_blank\">sepsis</a>). This risk must be carefully weighed. Splenectomy does not affect iron overload.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLastly, people with very severe CDA-2 may be candidates for\r\nhematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
