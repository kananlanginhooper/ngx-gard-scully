Affected people have an abnormal connection between the pulmonary vein (carries blood from the lungs to the heart) and pulmonary artery (carries blood from the heart to the lungs). As a result, blood may not be properly oxygenated by the lungs. Some affected people may have no signs or symptoms of the condition. When present, symptoms may include difficulty breathing, nosebleeds, shortness of breath, difficulty exercising, and blue skin. Most people with PAVM have an inherited condition called <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/6626/hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia</a>, which is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner.
