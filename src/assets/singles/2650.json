HIT is usually an immune response which typically occurs 4-10 days after exposure to heparin; it can lead to serious complications and be life-threatening. This condition occurs in up to 5% of those who are exposed to heparin. Characteristic signs of HIT are a drop in platelet count of&nbsp; greater than 50% and/or the formation&nbsp;of new blood clots&nbsp;during heparin therapy.&nbsp; The first step of treatment&nbsp;is to discontinue and avoid all heparin products immediately.&nbsp;Often, affected individuals require another medicine to prevent blood clotting (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/bloodthinners.html\" target=\"_blank\">anticoagulants</a>).
