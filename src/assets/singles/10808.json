This occurs because the body begins to make a specific kind of protein called <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002223.htm\">antibodies</a> to attack insulin. <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/treatment-and-care/medication/insulin/insulin-basics.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/\">Insulin</a> is a naturally occurring hormone that is responsible for keeping blood sugar at a normal level. When blood sugar levels get too high, insulin helps to store the sugar for future use. People affected by insulin autoimmune syndrome have antibodies that attack insulin, causing it to work too hard and the level of blood sugar to become too low. Insulin autoimmune syndrome most often begins during adulthood.[12581][12582]<br />","dateModified":"2016-11-13T18:53:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":11314,"questionText":"What are the symptoms of insulin autoimmune syndrome?","answerText":"The symptoms of insulin autoimmune syndrome are similar to those of other disorders that cause low blood sugar.

Because a person affected by this condition is producing antibodies to attack a naturally occurring substance, the condition is classified as a type of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000816.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autoimmune syndrome</a>. This means that the immune system, which is responsible for protecting the body from disease, is instead attacking the body itself.[12581] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nExactly why these antibodies against insulin are suddenly produced can vary from person to person. In some cases, insulin autoimmune syndrome occurs in a person with another autoimmune disease, which can indicate that the immune system in the body is not behaving correctly. Additionally, a certain class of medications called sulphydryl compounds have been shown to sometimes cause insulin autoimmune syndrome. Some of these medications are used to treat other autoimmune conditions. Recently, a compound called alpha-lipoic acid has been associated with an increased risk of developing insulin autoimmune syndrome. This compound is sometimes used for dieting purposes.[12585]&nbsp;<br />","dateModified":"2016-11-13T20:06:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":12581,"authors":"Archambeaud-Mouveroux, F, Huc, MC, Nadalon, S, Fournier, MP, and B Canivet","articleTitle":"Autoimmune insulin syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy","date":"1989","volume":"43(8)","pages":"581-586","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2698754","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12585,"authors":"Uchigata, Y, Hirata, Y, and Y Iwamoto","articleTitle":"Drug-induced insulin autoimmune syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice","date":"January 2009","volume":"83(1)","pages":"e19-20","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19070385","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":11316,"questionText":"How is insulin autoimmune syndrome diagnosed?","answerText":"Insulin autoimmune syndrome may be diagnosed by measuring blood sugar levels, insulin levels, and ruling out other conditions that can cause low blood sugar.
