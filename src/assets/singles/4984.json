Some people develop a severe form in early childhood, and others develop a milder form in childhood or later. Short stature is due to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/Nemours/en/parents/az-sed.html\" target=\"_blank\">spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia</a>, which involves abnormal development of the spine and the ends of the long bones.
