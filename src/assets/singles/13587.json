The mutations can impair RAG complex formation and function, resulting in an impaired B and T cells' function. Depending on the residual activity of the RAG proteins the disease can be more or less severe. In less severe cases symptoms are milder and may appear later in life.[14797][14798][14799] Treatment is with <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-bone-marrow-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\">bone marrow transplantation</a>.[14799]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2018-07-12T13:23:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
