As the disease progresses, people become weaker and are eventually wheelchair-dependent. Death often results from respiratory failure within 2 to 10 years after the symptoms begin.[5738][13403]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost people with ALS have a sporadic (not inherited) form of ALS. It is believed that these cases are caused by an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. This means that a person may have inherited genetic changes (variants) that increase their risk to develop ALS, but the person will only develop ALS if exposed to certain environmental triggers. About 10% of the people with ALS have at least one relative with the disease and are said to have have a familial (inherited) form of the disease (FALS). Familial ALS may be caused by changes (pathogenic variants, also known as mutations) in any one of several genes and the pattern of inheritance varies depending on the gene involved. The distinction between sporadic and familial cases is not always clear.[5738][13403]&nbsp; The average age at which symptoms begin is 56 years old in the sporadic cases and 46 years old in the familial cases.[134]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiagnosis of ALS is based on symptoms and a variety of tests to rule out other possible medical diseases that can cause similar symptoms.[134][2687] The goal of treatment is to improve the quality of life for people with ALS, by assisting with breathing, nutrition, mobility, and communication.[13403][5739] Medications specifically approved for the treatment of ALS in the United States include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a696013.html\" target=\"_blank\">riluzole</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a617027.html\" target=\"_blank\">edaravone</a>.[14946][14947]","dateModified":"2018-09-27T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6662,"questionText":"Is&nbsp;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) inherited?","answerText":"About 90-95% percent of cases of ALS are <em>not</em> inherited and occur in individuals with no history of the disease in their family. The remaining 5-10% of cases are familial, and are thought to be caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in any one of several <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">genes</a>. The inheritance pattern associated with familial ALS varies depending on the disease-causing gene involved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost familial cases are inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner. This means that only one altered (mutated) copy of the disease-causing gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In most of these cases, an affected individual has one parent with the condition. When an individual with an autosomal dominant form of ALS has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherited the mutated copy of the gene and be affected.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLess frequently, ALS is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> manner. In autosomal recessive inheritance, both copies of the disease-causing gene (typically one copy inherited from each parent) must have a mutation for the individual to be affected. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition, who presumably each carry one mutated copy of the gene, are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers for the same condition are having children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% risk to not have the condition <em>and</em> not be a carrier. Autosomal recessive forms of ALS may be mistaken for non-inherited (sporadic) forms due to having a negative family history of the condition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn rare cases, ALS is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.genetics.edu.au/Publications-and-Resources/Genetics-Fact-Sheets/FactSheet10A\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked dominant</a> manner. This occurs when the disease-causing gene is located on the X chromosome (a sex chromosome). Although females have 2 X chromosomes, having a mutation in one X chromosome is still sufficient to cause the condition. Males who have a mutation (and only one X chromosome) will have the condition. Usually, males with an X-linked dominant form of ALS experience more severe symptoms than females with the same form.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome individuals who do inherit a mutation known to cause ALS never develop signs and symptoms of ALS, although the reason for this is unclear. This phenomenon is referred to as <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/inheritance/penetranceexpressivity\" target=\"_blank\">reduced penetrance</a>.[5738]","dateModified":"2017-05-09T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[{"referenceId":5738,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"August 2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":191,"questionText":"How is&nbsp;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diagnosed?","answerText":"Diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may be suspected due to symptoms and the history of the way the symptoms progressed. ALS is usually strongly considered if the symptoms suggest both upper and lower motor neurons are affected. Basically, upper motor neurons (UPN) are found in the brain, whereas lower motor neurons are found in the spinal cord (LMN). UMN problems that can be found in a physical exam include tight and stiff muscles (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003297.htm\" target=\"_blank\">spasticity</a>), quicker than normal reflexes, and the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003294.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Babinski reflex</a>, which is when stroking the bottom of the foot causes the big toe to move upward and is not normally present after the age of 2 years.

Riluzole has been available in tablet form for over twenty years. It is believed to reduce damage to <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/motor%20neuron\" target=\"_blank\">motor neurons</a>. Riluzole may increase survival by several months and also extend the time before mechanical breathing support (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000458.htm\" target=\"_blank\">ventilation</a>) is needed. Riluzole does not reverse damage already done to motor neurons. The tablet form is available in generic versions and has been approved by the drug regulating agencies of most countries.[14946][14947] As of 2018, a liquid form,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tiglutik.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tiglutik</a>, has been approved by the FDA, which allows those who have a hard time swallowing a tablet to continue treatment.[14963]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEdaravone (<a href=\"https://www.radicava.com\" target=\"_blank\">Radicava</a>) has been available in the United States since 2017. It is an antioxidant and may slow the decline of physical function in some people with ALS. Physical function is measured by ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSDRS-R). This scale measures problems with speech, swallowing, and breathing, as well as daily functioning such as walking, holding items like a pen or fork, dressing, and general care of oneself, like bathing. Edaravone  does not improve function that has already been lost. The clinical trials took place in Japan and were six months long. As of 2018, long term effects of treatment with edaravone on physical function, survival, and quality of life are not known. It can be used along with riluzole. Edaravone is delivered by <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002383.htm\" target=\"_blank\">IV infusion</a> on usually a two week on, two week off cycle. The IV infusion takes about one hour and is initially given in a hospital or clinic setting, but many have been able to transition to having the IV infusions at home.[14946][14947] Edaravone is also approved by regulating agencies in Japan and South Korea, and is waiting for approval in Canada, Switzerland, and the European Union as of 2018.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther treatments for ALS are designed to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients.

The remaining 5-10% of cases are familial, and are thought to be caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in any one of several <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">genes</a>. The inheritance pattern associated with familial ALS varies depending on the disease-causing gene involved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost familial cases are inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner. This means that only one altered (mutated) copy of the disease-causing gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In most of these cases, an affected individual has one parent with the condition. When an individual with an autosomal dominant form of ALS has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherited the mutated copy of the gene and be affected.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLess frequently, ALS is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> manner. In autosomal recessive inheritance, both copies of the disease-causing gene (typically one copy inherited from each parent) must have a mutation for the individual to be affected. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition, who presumably each carry one mutated copy of the gene, are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers for the same condition are having children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each parent, and a 25% risk to not have the condition <em>and</em> not be a carrier. Autosomal recessive forms of ALS may be mistaken for non-inherited (sporadic) forms due to having a negative family history of the condition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn rare cases, ALS is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.genetics.edu.au/Publications-and-Resources/Genetics-Fact-Sheets/FactSheet10A\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked dominant</a> manner. This occurs when the disease-causing gene is located on the X chromosome (a sex chromosome). Although females have 2 X chromosomes, having a mutation in one X chromosome is still sufficient to cause the condition. Males who have a mutation (and only one X chromosome) will have the condition. Usually, males with an X-linked dominant form of ALS experience more severe symptoms than females with the same form.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome individuals who do inherit a mutation known to cause ALS never develop signs and symptoms of ALS, although the reason for this is unclear.

Riluzole has been available in tablet form for over twenty years. It is believed to reduce damage to <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/motor%20neuron\" target=\"_blank\">motor neurons</a>. Riluzole may increase survival by several months and also extend the time before mechanical breathing support (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000458.htm\" target=\"_blank\">ventilation</a>) is needed. Riluzole does not reverse damage already done to motor neurons. The tablet form is available in generic versions and has been approved by the drug regulating agencies of most countries.[14946][14947] As of 2018, a liquid form,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tiglutik.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tiglutik</a>, has been approved by the FDA, which allows those who have a hard time swallowing a tablet to continue treatment.[14963]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEdaravone (<a href=\"https://www.radicava.com\" target=\"_blank\">Radicava</a>) has been available in the United States since 2017. It is an antioxidant and may slow the decline of physical function in some people with ALS. Physical function is measured by ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSDRS-R). This scale measures problems with speech, swallowing, and breathing, as well as daily functioning such as walking, holding items like a pen or fork, dressing, and general care of oneself, like bathing. Edaravone  does not improve function that has already been lost. The clinical trials took place in Japan and were six months long. As of 2018, long term effects of treatment with edaravone on physical function, survival, and quality of life are not known. It can be used along with riluzole. Edaravone is delivered by <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002383.htm\" target=\"_blank\">IV infusion</a> on usually a two week on, two week off cycle. The IV infusion takes about one hour and is initially given in a hospital or clinic setting, but many have been able to transition to having the IV infusions at home.[14946][14947] Edaravone is also approved by regulating agencies in Japan and South Korea, and is waiting for approval in Canada, Switzerland, and the European Union as of 2018.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther treatments for ALS are designed to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients.
