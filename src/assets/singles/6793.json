Plasma exchange may provide short-term relief for people with some forms of acquired Isaacs' syndrome. Plasma exchange is a method by which whole blood is removed from the body and processed so that the red and white blood cells are separated from the plasma (liquid portion of the blood). The blood cells are then returned to the patient without the plasma, which the body quickly replaces. If there is no response or poor response to plasma exchange, some studies suggest that intravenous infusions of immunoglobulins (IvIg therapy) may be beneficial.[454][9652]","dateModified":"2015-09-17T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":454,"authors":"","articleTitle":"NINDS Isaac's Syndrome Information Page","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)","date":"September 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Isaacs-syndrome-Information-Page","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9652,"authors":"Ahmed A, Simmons Z","articleTitle":"Isaacs syndrome: A review","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Muscle Nerve","date":"July 2015","volume":"52(1)","pages":"5-12","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":692,"questionText":"What is the long-term outlook for people with Isaacs' syndrome?","answerText":"The long-term outlook (prognosis) for people with Isaacs' syndrome varies and largely depends on the underlying cause.
