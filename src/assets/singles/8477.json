While studies suggest that most individuals with renal oncocytoma report symptoms once tumor size is greater than 5 cm, there are several factors taken into account when considering management options. These factors might include: manifesting symptoms, tumor growth rate, existing comorbidities, and the development of <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=46710\" target=\"_blank\">metastasis</a>. [8308][11059] We would recommend that you discuss your concerns with your physicians as they are aware of your medical history and whether the renal oncocytoma is progressing.","dateModified":"2016-03-29T13:19:00","references":[{"referenceId":8308,"authors":"Sanjeeva P Kalva, MD","articleTitle":"Renal Oncocytoma Imaging","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"October 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/379653-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11059,"authors":"Nikita R.
