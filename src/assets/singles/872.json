This condition also impairs the body's ability to process ketones, which are molecules produced during the breakdown of fats.&nbsp;Signs and symptoms typically appear between the ages of 6 and 24 months. Affected children experience intermittent episodes of ketoacidosis, characterized by vomiting, dehydration, difficulty breathing, extreme tiredness (lethargy), and occasionally, seizures. In severe cases, these episodes can lead to coma.[4037][13526][13527] Metabolic stroke is another finding that has been increasingly reported in children with this condition.[13526]&nbsp;Ketoacidotic attacks are frequently triggered by infections, periods without food (fasting), or increased intake of protein-rich foods.[4037][13526]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeta ketothiolase deficiency&nbsp;is inherited in an <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/illustrations/autorecessive\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>&nbsp;fashion and is caused by pathogenic variants (<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>) in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ACAT1\" target=\"_blank\">ACAT1</a></em> gene.[4037][13526][13527] Treatment involves managing acute crises with intravenous (IV) fluids, glucose, and electrolytes along with bicarbonate.

The optimal time to determine genetic risk, clarify carrier status of parents, and discuss the availability of prenatal testing is before pregnancy.&nbsp;Genetic counseling (which includes a discussion of potential risks to offspring as well as&nbsp;reproductive options) is recommended for individuals who are affected, are carriers, or are at risk of being carriers for genetic disorders.<br><br>Finding out the genetic status of the fetus during a pregnancy for pregnancies at high risk (i.e. those at 25% risk based on family history) is possible either by&nbsp;analyzing T2 activity&nbsp;(the defective&nbsp;enzyme in the disorder)&nbsp;or by detecting&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=_blank>mutations</a> in fetal&nbsp;DNA.[4562] These&nbsp;tests can be performed following either&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003406.htm\" target=_blank>chorionic villus sampling</a> (CVS)&nbsp;between approximately 10&nbsp;and 12 weeks gestation, or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003921.htm\" target=_blank>amniocentesis</a> usually between 15&nbsp;and 18 weeks gestation. For couples seeking DNA analysis to identify whether the fetus has inherited&nbsp;specific disease-causing mutations, the&nbsp;mutations&nbsp;in&nbsp;an affected family member or in the carrier parents must be known before prenatal testing can be performed.<br><br>As an alternative to prenatal diagnosis during the pregnancy, <a href=\"https://www.asrm.org/FACTSHEET_Preimplantation_genetic_testing/\" target=_blank>preimplantation genetic diagnosis</a> (PGD) may be available months before&nbsp;a pregnancy begins&nbsp;if the disease-causing mutations have been identified. Preimplantation diagnosis is&nbsp;done following <a href=\"http://www.americanpregnancy.org/infertility/ivf.html\" target=_blank>in vitro fertilization</a>&nbsp;(IVF) to diagnose a genetic disease in an embryo before it is introduced into the uterus. When doing PGD, laboratories can test a single cell from an embryo that is just days old. Besides testing for the specific disorder in question, PGD can also provide information about whether the embryo is male or female and whether it is carrying chromosomal abnormalities or rearrangements.[3350]<br><br>GeneTests lists the names of laboratories that are performing testing for beta ketothiolase deficiency.
