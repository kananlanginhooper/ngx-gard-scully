In atrophic LP, specifically, affected people develop pale papules or plaques with an atrophic (broken down tissue) center. Although these papules can be found anywhere on the body, they most commonly affect the trunk and/or legs on skin areas previously affected by classic lichen planus. The exact underlying cause of atrophic LP is unknown. Treatment is not always necessary as some cases of atrophic LP resolve on their own. Mild cases can often be managed with <a href=\"http://dermnetnz.org/treatments/topical-steroids.html\" target=\"_blank\">topical steroids</a>, while more intensive therapies may be required for severe cases.[9322][9326]","dateModified":"2015-07-16T14:01:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":9279,"authors":"Zaraa I & cols","articleTitle":"Lichen planus pemphigoides: four new cases and a review of the literature","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Int J Dermatol","date":"April, 2013","volume":"52(4)","pages":"406-12","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23331194","dateAccessed":"2015-07-10T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12344,"relatedDiseaseName":"Rare lichen planus","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
