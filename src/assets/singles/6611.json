How can we know if it is hereditary amyloidosis or not?","caseQuestions":[{"questionId":2051,"questionText":"What&nbsp;is hereditary amyloidosis?","answerText":"<strong>Hereditary amyloidosis</strong>&nbsp;refers to&nbsp;a group of inherited conditions that make up one of the subtypes of <a href=\"http://www.amyloidosis.org/facts/\" target=\"_blank\">amyloidosis</a>.&nbsp;Hereditary amyloidosis&nbsp;is characterized by the deposit of an abnormal&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary.cfm?key=protein\" target=\"_blank\">protein</a> called amyloid in&nbsp;multiple organs of the body where it should not be, which causes disruption of organ tissue structure and function.[1256] In hereditary amyloidosis, amyloid deposits most often occur in tissues of the heart, kidneys, and nervous system.[11874] While symptoms of hereditary amyloidosis may appear in childhood, most individuals do not experience symptoms until adulthood.[11872] There are many types of hereditary amyloidosis associated with different gene <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>  and abnormal proteins. The most common type of hereditary amyloidosis is <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/656/Transthyretin_amyloid_neuropathy.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">transthyretin amyloidosis</a>&nbsp;(ATTR),&nbsp;a condition in which the amyloid deposits are most often made up of the transthyretin protein which is made in the liver.

However, not everyone with a <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary.cfm?key=mutation\" target=_blank>mutation</a> in&nbsp;a <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary.cfm?key=gene\" target=_blank>gene</a> associated with hereditary amyloidosis will develop symptoms. Additionally,&nbsp;symptoms of the disease typically do not&nbsp;appear until older age and the condition may have been misdiagnosed in other affected family members. For these reasons, the absence of a family history may be misleading.[1256] <br><br>The diagnosis of&nbsp;amyloidosis is usually made by performing a tissue biopsy and staining the tissue with Congo red stain to detect the presence or absence of amyloid deposits. The biopsy may be from any affected organ, but biopsying the <a href=\"http://assets.aarp.org/external_sites/adam/graphics/images/en/19218.jpg\" target=_blank>rectal mucosa</a> generally results in&nbsp;better detection of the&nbsp;following hereditary amyloidoses: transthyretin amyloidosis, apolipoprotein AI amyloidosis, fibrinogen A&#945;-chain amyloidosis (A Fib), and apolipoprotein AII amyloidosis (A ApoAII).[1256] <br><br>Additionally, when a hereditary amyloidoses is suspected, genetic testing may be able to confirm a diagnosis. It is important to note that genetic testing may not be available for all types of hereditary amyloidoses. For those individuals interested in pursuing genetic testing, we recommend scheduling a <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/consult?show=all\" target=_blank>genetics consultation</a> to determine whether genetic testing would be appropriate and available.
