The tumor usually starts as a small, firm patch of skin; it may be purplish, reddish, or flesh-colored. It is commonly found on the torso, usually in the shoulder and chest area. The tumor typically grows slowly but has a tendency to recur after being removed. It rarely spreads to other parts of the body. The cause of DFSP is unknown, but injury to the affected skin may be a predisposing factor. Treatment usually involves surgically removing the tumor. If the tumor is unable to be removed completely, additional therapy may be needed. Regular follow-up is important to monitor for recurrence.[10607][10608][10609]","dateModified":"2016-02-09T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":10127,"questionText":"What causes Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans?","answerText":"The cause of DFSP is unknown but an injury to the affected skin may be a predisposing factor.[10607] Trauma at the affected site has been reported in approximately 10-20% of patients. [10609] Recent advances have shown that in approximately 90% of cases, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is associated with a rearrangement (<a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=201\" target=\"_blank\">translocation</a>)&nbsp;of genetic material between <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002327.htm\" target=\"_blank\">chromosomes</a>  17 and 22 which results in the fusion of two genes. The fused gene produces a protein which some believe may stimulate cells to multiply, leading to the tumor formation seen in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.
