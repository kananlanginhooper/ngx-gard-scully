However in some cases, a pancreatic NET occurs outside of the pancreas. A NET arises from cells that produce hormones, so the tumor can also produce hormones.[14645] It may be benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Pancreatic NETs  usually grow slowly over many years, but there are fast-growing forms.[14645]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPancreatic NETs are called either functional or nonfunctional. A functional pancreatic NET causes specific symptoms because it makes extra hormones, such as gastrin, insulin, or glucagon.[14645][14646] Examples of types of functional pancreatic NETs include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000387.htm\" target=\"_blank\">insulinomas</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000326.htm\" target=\"_blank\">glucagonomas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.yourhormones.info/endocrine-conditions/gastrinoma/\" target=\"_blank\">gastrinomas</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000228.htm\" target=\"_blank\">VIPomas</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.yourhormones.info/endocrine-conditions/somatostatinoma/\" target=\"_blank\">somatostatinomas</a>.[14645] Symptoms depend on the type of hormone being made.[14646] A nonfunctional pancreatic NET generally does not cause specific symptoms, but may eventually cause symptoms relating to its location and size as it grows or spreads.[14646] Pancreatic NETs can be hard to diagnosis, often not identified until 5 to 10 years after they begin to grow.[14645]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost pancreatic NETs are not inherited and occur sporadically in people with no family history of NETs. However, about 10% are associated with a hereditary cancer or tumor syndrome such as <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/3829/men1\" target=\"_blank\">multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1</a> (MEN1), which has autosomal dominant inheritance.[14647]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment options for each person depend on many factors including the type of tumor, its location, whether it has spread to other parts of the body (metastasized), and symptoms present.[14645] Treatment options may include surgery to remove all or part of the tumor (and sometimes the lymph nodes), and/or nonsurgical treatments to shrink the tumor, stop it from growing, or alleviate symptoms.[14645] The chance of recovery (prognosis) also depends upon these factors and differs from person to person.[14646]","dateModified":"2018-05-18T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":2496,"relatedDiseaseName":"Glucagonoma","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":3010,"relatedDiseaseName":"Insulinoma","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":13445,"relatedDiseaseName":"Neuroendocrine tumor","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":4900,"relatedDiseaseName":"Somatostatinoma","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
