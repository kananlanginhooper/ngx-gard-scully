This type of DNA contains many genes essential for normal mitochondrial function. People with Kearns-Sayre syndrome have a single, large deletion of mtDNA which results in the loss of genes important for mitochondrial formation and oxydative phosphorylation. While researchers have not determined how these deletions cause the features of Kearns-Sayre syndrome, they may be related to a lack of cellular energy The underlying cause of the deletion in affected individuals remains unknown.[8012]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2014-12-17T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":8012,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Kearns-Sayre syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"December 2011","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/kearns-sayre-syndrome","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":1520,"questionText":"How might Kearns-Sayre syndrome be treated?","answerText":"<div class=\"rxbodyfield\" xmlns:w=\"urn:www.microsoft.com/word\" xmlns:st1=\"urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags\" xmlns:o=\"urn:www.microsoft.com/office\">Treatment for Kearns-Sayre syndrome&nbsp;is generally symptomatic and supportive.[902] Management options include placement of cardiac pacemakers in individuals with cardiac conduction blocks, eyelid slings for severe <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003035.htm\" target=\"_blank\">ptosis</a>, cochlear implants and hearing aids for neurosensory hearing loss, hormone replacement for endocrinopathies, dilation of the upper esophageal sphincter to alleviate <a href=\"http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/cricopharyngeal+achalasia\" target=\"_blank\">cricopharyngeal achalasia</a>, folinic acid supplementation in individuals with Kearns-Sayre syndrome&nbsp;with low&nbsp;cerebral spinal fluid&nbsp;folic acid, administration of coenzyme Q10 and L-carnitine, physical and occupational therapy, and treatment of depression.
