PGD is done after IVF to diagnose a genetic condition in an embryo before it is introduced into the uterus. When having PGD, only embryos known to be unaffected are introduced into the uterus for a possible pregnancy.&nbsp;PGD does not involve the modification of genetic material (gene therapy) to remove a mutation from an affected embryo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPGD typically requires that the specific, genetic&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>&nbsp;responsible for a disorder in a family have been identified. Mutations may be identified in an affected family member, or in parents who are <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/?id=23\" target=\"_blank\">carriers</a>. Therefore, advanced planning and testing is needed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>While we are not aware of specific laboratories that offer PGD for Pierson syndrome, some laboratories that perform PGD are able to do \"custom\" testing for most types of mutations.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nGender selection, or sex selection, may be used during PGD with IVF for medical reasons to prevent genetic disorders known to affect only males, or known to be more severe in males (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=209\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked</a>&nbsp;disorders). Pierson syndrome is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>&nbsp;manner, affecting both sexes equally.&nbsp;Sometimes gender selection is \"elective\" when a specific gender is desired without obvious medical reasons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs an alternative to IVF and PGD, it may be possible to find out in early pregnancy whether a fetus is affected.&nbsp;If the mutations in a family are known, prenatal genetic testing may be possible during pregnancy. Genetic testing may be performed on a sample obtained by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003406.htm\" target=\"_blank\">chorionic villus sampling</a>&nbsp;(at about 10 to 12 weeks gestation), or by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003921.htm\" target=\"_blank\">amniocentesis</a>&nbsp;(usually performed at about 15 to 18 weeks gestation). If the condition is confirmed in the fetus after either method, planning for an affected child and/or pregnancy management options may be discussed with a health care provider.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUltrasound may also be used as a screening test to detect signs or symptoms of the disorder in an affected fetus. However, if no abnormalities are detected on ultrasound, the possibility that the fetus is or will be affected cannot be ruled out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople interested in genetic testing, prenatal diagnosis, and/or PGD should speak with a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/geneticcounseling.html\" target=\"_blank\">genetic counselor</a>&nbsp;or other&nbsp;genetics professional regarding their testing options.&nbsp;A genetics professional can help by:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>thoroughly evaluating the family history</li>\r\n    <li>addressing questions and concerns</li>\r\n    <li>assessing recurrence risks</li>\r\n    <li>facilitating genetic testing if desired</li>\r\n    <li>discussing reproductive options</li>\r\n</ul>","dateModified":"2016-03-24T00:00:00","references":[]},{"questionId":10348,"questionText":"Is genetic testing available for Pierson syndrome?","answerText":"Yes.&nbsp;The <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/conditions/C1836876/\" target=\"_blank\">Genetic Testing Registry</a> (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests available for Pierson syndrome.
