Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA).[1295] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe genes related to Leber hereditary optic neuropathy each provide instructions for making a protein involved in normal mitochondrial function. These proteins are part of a large enzyme complex in mitochondria that helps convert oxygen and simple sugars to energy. Mutations in any of the genes disrupt this process. It remains unclear how these genetic changes cause the death of cells in the optic nerve and lead to the specific features of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.[1295] Please&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=leberhereditaryopticneuropathy#genes\">visit&nbsp;the Genetic Home Reference Web site</a> to learn more about how mutations in these genes cause Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.","dateModified":"2017-03-13T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":1295,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Leber hereditary optic neuropathy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/leber-hereditary-optic-neuropathy","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":2127,"questionText":"Do all people with these gene mutations develop Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)?","answerText":"No. Many people with a mutation that causes LHON do not develop any features of the disorder (more than 50% of males with a mutation and more than 85 % of females with a mutation never will have vision loss or other medical problems related to LHON).
