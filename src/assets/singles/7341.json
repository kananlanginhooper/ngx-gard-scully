Trisomy 13 is typically due to having three full copies of <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/13\" target=\"_blank\">chromosome 13</a> in each cell in the body, instead of the usual two copies. This is referred to as complete trisomy 13 or full trisomy 13.

Approximately 20% of cases of trisomy 13 are caused by translocation trisomy 13.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn rare cases, only part of chromosome 13 is present in three copies in each cell (rather than the full chromosome); this is called partial trisomy 13.

An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in an egg or sperm cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, an egg or sperm cell may gain an extra copy of chromosome 13. If one of these contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, the child will have an extra chromosome 13 in each cell of the body.[2976]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor a woman who has never had a pregnancy or child with a trisomy, the risk to have a pregnancy with a chromosome abnormality would typically be her age-related risk - the risk increases with maternal age. For a woman who has had an affected pregnancy or child in the past, the recurrence risk is generally quoted as about 1% <em>or</em> the maternal age-related risk - whichever is higher at the time of pregnancy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the other hand, translocation trisomy 13 can be inherited. An unaffected parent can have a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome 13 and another chromosome.

Or do they all have an equal prognosis?","caseQuestions":[{"questionId":8697,"questionText":"Does the prognosis differ depending on the type of trisomy 13 a fetus has?","answerText":"To our knowledge, there is no difference in prognosis between fetuses with full trisomy 13 and those with <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=201\" target=\"_blank\">translocation</a> trisomy 13 involving a <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=robertsoniantranslocation\" target=\"_blank\">Robertsonian translocation</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChromosome 13 is one of the acrocentric chromosomes (the others are 14, 15, 21 and 22). A chromosome is acrocentric if the <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=29\" target=\"_blank\">centromere</a> (a part needed for chromosome separation during cell division) is very near one end of the chromosome. The position of the centromere is how we distinguish a chromosome's \"long arm\" from its \"short arm.\" When there is a Robertsonian translocation, 2 of the acrocentric chromosomes are broken at the beginning of the short arm (at the centromere). The long arms are then fused together, so the resulting chromosome has 2 long arms only. While the short arms of the 2 chromosome involved are lost, the lost material causes no health problems because the genes usually present are available on the short arms of the other acrocentric chromosomes. In other words, the acrocentric chromosomes have no \"unique\" genes on their short arms.[8826] This means that having an extra full copy of chromosome 13 and having an extra copy of only the long arm of chromosome 13 are thought to cause the same condition.

In mosaic trisomy 13, there is an extra chromosome 13 in some of the cells of the body - but not all.

In partial trisomy 13, only part of the unique genetic material from chromosome 13 is present in 3 copies (in all the cells of the body). In this case, the prognosis may depend on how much of chromosome 13 is present in 3 copies, as well as the specific genes involved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople with questions about genetic risks, or prognosis relating to a specific genetic condition, should speak with a genetics professional.","dateModified":"2015-05-04T11:17:00","references":[{"referenceId":8826,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Robertsonian Translocations","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Unique","date":"2005","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.rarechromo.org/information/other/robertsonian%20translocations%20ftnw.pdf","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":2567,"questionText":"How can I find a genetics professional in my area?","answerText":"To find a medical professional who specializes in genetics, you can ask your doctor for a referral or you can search for one yourself.
