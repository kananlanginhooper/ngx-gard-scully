It was traditionally divided in hereditary or genetic OPCA and sporadic OPCA. Currently,&nbsp;most of the major forms of hereditary OPCA  refer to disorders that overlap  with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10748/spinocerebellar-ataxia\" target=\"_blank\">spinocerebellar ataxia</a>&nbsp;(SCA), which is a neurological disorder characterized by ataxia.
