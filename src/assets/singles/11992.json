It is associated with susceptibility to disseminated infections (dispersed throughout the body) caused by organisms that typically affect only people with weak immune systems (opportunistic pathogens).[13195] People with this disorder produce higher amounts of anti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies. These are specific immune system proteins that mistakenly target a person's own tissues. It is predominantly reported in Southeast Asians who were previously healthy.[13195][13194] The age of onset is usually around 30-50 years.[13195][13193]&nbsp;Pathogens that cause infections in people with this disorder may include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://labtestsonline.org/understanding/conditions/ntm/\" target=\"_blank\">non-tuberculous mycobacteria</a>, <a href=\"https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/infections/bacterial-infections/salmonella-infections\" target=\"_blank\">non-typhoidal salmonella</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cytomegalovirusinfections.html\" target=\"_blank\">cytomegalovirus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-penicillium-talaromyces-marneffei-infection?source=search_result&amp;search=Penicillium+%28Talaromyces%29+marneffei+infection&amp;selectedTitle=1~17\" target=\"_blank\">Penicillium marneffei</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/condition/varicellazoster-virus\" target=\"_blank\">varicella zoster virus</a>.[13193] Symptoms depend on the infection(s) present in each person.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cause of developing anti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies is unclear, but genetic factors are suspected to be involved.[13194] Studies have suggested an association with certain <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genefamily/hla\" target=\"_blank\">HLA genes</a>.[13194] These genes help the immune system distinguish between the body's own proteins and those made by foreign invaders.[13196] Some have suggested that an infection may initially trigger the production of autoantibodies, and repeated infections lead to their increased activity.[13193]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is currently no standard therapy and treatment depends on the infection(s) present. Therapies used in the past have included long-term antimicrobial therapy (such as antibiotics or antifungals) and <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/rituximab-intravenous-route/description/drg-20068057\" target=\"_blank\">rituximab therapy</a>.
