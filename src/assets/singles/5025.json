The recommended therapies aim to address issues moving the joints that may develop as a symptom of SSS. Regular <a href=\"http://www.apta.org/AboutPTs/\">physical therapy</a> and exercise may be recommended to improve or maintain joint movement. A number of treatments have been tried in individual cases, including <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/steroids.html\">steroids</a>, <a href=\"http://www.healthline.com/health/immunosuppressant-drugs\">immunosuppressant drugs</a>, psoralens (light-sensitizing medications), and light therapy. These treatments have not been helpful in slowing or stopping symptoms of SSS.[7838] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome study findings on animal models have indicated potential future therapeutic options. In one study, mice with stiff skin syndrome were treated by blocking certain <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002223.htm\">antibodies</a> (integrin binding and TGF-beta antibodies). This prevented new skin lesions and reversed existing ones.[7839] You can read more about this discovery through the following link to the Scleroderma Research Society: <a href=\"http://www.srfcure.org/research/funded-research/3301-interrogation\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.srfcure.org/research/funded-research/3301-interrogation</a>&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother recent paper discussed the possibility of using a medication that suppresses the immune system called <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601081.html\">mycophenolate mofetil</a> in combination with physical therapy to treat individuals with stiff skin syndrome. Although this treatment has only been used for a couple of affected individuals, the doctors noted an improvement in symptoms. However, these individuals had the segmental form of stiff skin syndrome. It is not known whether this treatment would work for every person with the segmental form of stiff skin syndrome, and it is not known if it will work at all for people with the classic form of stiff skin syndrome.[13834]<br />","dateModified":"2017-09-21T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":7838,"authors":"Amorim AG, Aide MK, Duraes SM, and Rochael MC","articleTitle":"Stiff skin syndrome--case report","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"An Bras Dermatol","date":"2011 Jul-Aug","volume":"86(4 Suppl 1)","pages":"S178-81","url":"http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0365-05962011000700046&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":7839,"authors":"Gerber EE, Gallo EM, Fontana SC, Davis EC, Wigley FM, Huso DL, and Dietz HC","articleTitle":"Integrin-modulating therapy prevents fibrosis and autoimmunity in mouse models of scleroderma","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Nature","date":"November 7, 2013","volume":"503(7474)","pages":"126-30","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3992987/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13834,"authors":"Kurtzman DJB, Wright NA, Patel M, and Vleugels RA","articleTitle":"Segmental stiff skin syndrome (SSS): Two additional cases with a positive response to mycophenolate mofetil and physical therapy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology","date":"December 2016","volume":"75(6)","pages":"237-239","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27846975","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":7881,"questionText":"What is the long-term outlook for people with stiff skin syndrome?","answerText":"There is very limited information about how stiff skin syndrome (SSS) affects a person during their teenage or adult years.
