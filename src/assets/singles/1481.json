The severity of CDH may range from a thinned area in part of the diaphragm, to its complete absence. CDH may allow the stomach and intestines to move through an opening (hernia) into the chest cavity, crowding the heart and lungs. This can then lead to underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), which may cause life-threatening complications.[5646] CDH may be associated with several syndromes (some caused by genetic mutations or a chromosome abnormality), it may be associated with other birth defects, or it may occur with no other abnormalities. It is rarely inherited.[5646] Treatment options depend on the type and severity of the defect and typically include surgery.[13144] Prenatal diagnosis and medical advances have increased the survival rate, but various long-term complications affecting health and development may occur.[13145][13152]","dateModified":"2017-03-06T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6555,"questionText":"What causes congenital diaphragmatic hernia?","answerText":"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) can occur as an isolated finding, as part of a genetic <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=192\" target=\"_blank\">syndrome</a> or <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/11508982#al-5\" target=\"_blank\">chromosome abnormality</a>, or with additional birth defects of unknown cause.[6288] Some cases have been linked to <em>in utero</em> exposures.[6289] In the majority of cases, the cause is not known.[6288]","dateModified":"2017-03-07T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":6288,"authors":"Barbara R Pober, Meaghan K Russell, and Kate Guernsey Ackerman","articleTitle":"Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Overview","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"March 16, 2010","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1359/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":6289,"authors":"Hedrick HL and Adzick NS","articleTitle":"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: Prenatal diagnosis and management","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"February, 2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"Waltham, MA","publisher":"UpToDate"}]},{"questionId":7102,"questionText":"What is the long-term outlook for&nbsp;fetuses or infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH)?","answerText":"The long-term outlook (prognosis) for those with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) depends on a number of factors and is hard to predict.
