Signs and symptoms typically begin during childhood or adolescence and worsen over time. Early symptoms include involuntary muscle jerking or twitching (stimulus-sensitive <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/myoclonus/detail_myoclonus.htm\" target=\"_blank\">myoclonus</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-seizures/tonic-clonic-seizures\" target=\"_blank\">tonic-clonic seizures</a>. Episodes of myoclonus may be brought on by exercise, stress, light, or other stimuli (triggers).  Over time, people with ULD develop <a href=\"https://ataxia.org/what-is-ataxia/\" target=\"_blank\">ataxia</a>, lack of coordination, <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Tremor-Fact-Sheet\" target=\"_blank\">intention tremor</a>, and difficulty speaking (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007470.htm\" target=\"_blank\">dysarthria</a>).

Treatment aims to control symptoms and increase quality of life. Treatment typically includes medications  to lessen the severity of myoclonus and the frequency of seizures, as well as psychosocial support.[14556] Myoclonus may be resistant to medications, while seizures can often be controlled. In the past, the life span of people with ULD was significantly shortened, but with advances in treatment and support, life expectancy now appears to be near normal.[14556]","dateModified":"2018-04-19T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":7140,"relatedDiseaseName":"Progressive myoclonic epilepsy","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
