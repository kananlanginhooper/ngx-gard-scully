BLT grows slowly into a bulky, cauliflower-shaped mass. It often spreads into surrounding tissues and causes damage. BLT is a sexually transmitted condition caused by specific types of the human papilloma virus (HPV). Risk factors for developing BLT include having a weak immune system, multiple sexual partners, alcoholism, and diabetes. Diagnosis is based on imaging studies and microscopic exam of a small piece of tumor tissue.  Treatment includes surgery and possibly chemotherapy, depending on the size of the tumor. Bushke-Lowenstein tumors have a tendency to come back, even after surgical removal. The outcome depends on the size of the tumor and how far it has spread.[15726][15727][15729][15730]","dateModified":"2020-08-07T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13582,"questionText":"What are the symptoms of a Buschke-Lowenstein tumor?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with Buschke-Lowenstein tumors.
