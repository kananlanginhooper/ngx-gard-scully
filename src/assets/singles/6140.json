While in most cases the cause of CVID is unknown, a genetic change has been found in about one-third of cases.[15376] This condition is diagnosed based on the symptoms, specific laboratory testings, and exclusion of other disorders.

However, immune globulins are normal components of human milk.[10913]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2009, researchers published a report about  two mothers with CVID and their infants. During pregnancy both women continued intravenous Ig (IVIG) therapy.&nbsp;The authors concluded that breastfeeding should be encouraged, as <a href=\"http://c.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/colostrum\" target=\"_blank\">colostrum</a> from these women provided immunological protection, plus nutritional and psychological benefits for the infant.[10912]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIVIG is considered a therapeutic option for mothers with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are breastfeeding. A study that included 69 women with MS who had received IVIG postpartum did not include any reports of serious adverse effects among the exposed nursing infants.[10913] In another&nbsp;case series of 43 women with MS who received 60 g IVIG within 3 days postpartum, and 10 g/month thereafter, there was only a transient rash one day after a mother's dose. The rash might have been from the IVIG. All women breastfed for at least 4 weeks.[10913]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe are unable to make recommendations about whether to breastfeed or formula feed, as this is a personal decision. While many health organizations recommend breastfeeding in general, breastfeeding may not be possible for all women, especially in specific medical situations.

However, with appropriate medical management and surveillance, women with CVID can have a pregnancy without increased risk of infection, and a baby born with adequate IgG levels.[7674] We are not aware of an increased risk of infertility (being unable to conceive) being directly associated with having CVID. However, women with CVID may be at increased risk for miscarriage.[7674][7675]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn infant's immune system is immature at birth, and during the first few months of life. Transport of IgG through the placenta (which occurs mainly after 32 weeks gestation) plays a central role in protecting the infant from infections.[7675] Having regular IgG replacement therapy is crucial both during pregnancy and during the first few weeks after childbirth. This therapy is needed for the mother's health, and for the baby's health (it provides immunological protection for the infant).[7675] Without therapy during pregnancy, fetuses and newborns may have an increased risk of infection.[7674]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStable, protective IgG levels are reached only after 3&ndash;6 months of replacement therapy. Therefore, IgG treatment should be started by the early stages of pregnancy to ensure stable levels in both the mother and the infant.[7675] Several case reports of pregnant women with CVID have indicated a need to increase the dosage of IgG throughout pregnancy to maintain adequate levels.[7673] Pregnant women with CVID should be regularly monitored (by both their immunologist and obstetrician), and adjustments to doses may be needed to prevent pregnancy-associated infections or potential complications.[7673] Stable IgG levels in the mother avoids having to infuse IgG in the infant.[7675] Another protective factor for the infant is breastfeeding.[7675]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNewborns of mothers with CVID should have serum IgG tested and be closely observed for infections. If IgG levels in the newborn are not high enough, IgG replacement therapy or donor breast milk supplements can be used depending on the severity of the IgG deficiency in the newborn.[7674]","dateModified":"2014-09-16T00:00:00","references":[{"referenceId":7673,"authors":"Brinker KA, Silk HJ","articleTitle":"Common variable immune deficiency and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin during pregnancy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol","date":"June, 2012","volume":"108(6)","pages":"464-465","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":7674,"authors":"Vitoratos N, Bakas P, Kalampani H, Creatsas G","articleTitle":"Maternal common variable immunodeficiency and pregnancy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Obstet Gynaecol","date":"November, 1999","volume":"19(6)","pages":"654-655","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":7675,"authors":"Danieli MG, Moretti R, Pettinari L, Gambini S","articleTitle":"Management of a pregnant woman with common variable immunodeficiency and previous reactions to intravenous IgG administration","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"BMJ Case Rep","date":"December 17, 2012","volume":"2012","pages":"","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}]}],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
