Because the skin is abnormal, infants are at risk for dehydration and infections, both of which may be life-threatening. Growth and weight gain may be slow and individuals with this condition are often shorter than average. Over time, the skin symptoms often improve. Many individuals have periodic outbreaks of red, circular rashes. Some individuals with Netherton syndrome have developmental and intellectual delays. In addition, individuals with this condition have an increased susceptibility to get skin infections and to develop skin cancers in adulthood.","dateModified":"2020-05-28T09:48:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":15607,"authors":"Sarri CA, Roussaki-Schulze A, Vasilopoulos Y, Zafiriou E, Patsatsi A, et al","articleTitle":"Netherton Syndrome: A Genotype-Phenotype Review","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Mol Diagn Therap","date":"Apr, 2017","volume":"21(2)","pages":"137-152","url":"www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27905021","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15609,"authors":"Saleem HMK, Shahid MF, Shahbaz A, Schail A, Sachmechi I.","articleTitle":"Netherton syndrome: A case report and review of the literature","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Cureus","date":"Jul 30, 2018","volume":"10(7)","pages":"e3070","url":"www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30280066","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":13479,"questionText":"How is Netherton syndrome inherited?","answerText":"Netherton syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
