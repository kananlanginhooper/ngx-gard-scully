It is characterized by the appearance or worsening of a palmar eruption, following brief exposure to water. The palmar eruption is made up of small, white or shining pimples that can conjoin into plaques. The feet are unaffected. Symptoms include a burning pain and a tightening sensation in the palms, as well as too much sweating.  There are two variants. Most commonly, it is a temporary and recurrent condition that appears after submersion in water, known as the &ldquo;hand in the bucket sign,&rdquo; that gets better within minutes to hours of drying. A less common variant is characterized by persistent lesions that are worsened after water submersion.[11295][11296][11297] The cause of aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma is unknown, but likely relates to sweating. Several studies have found that it is present in about 40% to 84% of <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cystic-fibrosis/basics/definition/CON-20013731\" target=\"_blank\">cystic fibrosis</a> patients and also in <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/?id=23\" target=\"_blank\">carriers</a>, which suggest that it may be caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>  in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CFTR\" target=\"_blank\"><em>CFTR</em></a> <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a>.[11297] It is more often found in young women. Besides cystic fibrosis, it is also seen in wasting (<a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/training/2.3/4.html\" target=\"_blank\">marasmus</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/nephrotic\" target=\"_blank\">nephrotic syndrome</a> and also with the use of aspirin and other drugs such as <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm106290.htm\" target=\"_blank\">rofecoxib</a> and <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-16851/celecoxib-oral/details\" target=\"_blank\">celecoxib</a>.[11299] In most cases it does not need any treatment and resolves spontaneously. When necessary, it can be treated with topical <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-9856/aluminum-chloride-topical/details\" target=\"_blank\">aluminum chloride</a> or <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-18-576/salicylic-acid-topical/salicylicacid6-topical/details\" target=\"_blank\">salicylic acid ointment</a> or with <a href=\"https://www.bcm.edu/healthcare/care-centers/baylor-dermatology/procedures/iontophoresis\" target=\"_blank\">tap water iontophoresis</a>.[11297][11298]","dateModified":"2016-04-19T23:20:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":11295,"authors":"Kent JB, Statuta SM, Greer KE & MacKnight JM","articleTitle":"Watersport hands","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Sports Health","date":"July, 2014","volume":"6(4)","pages":"360-2.","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4065561/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11296,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Aquagenic wrinkling of the palms","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"DermNet NZ","date":"2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.dermnetnz.org/reactions/wrinkling.html","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11297,"authors":"Cabrol C & cols","articleTitle":"Aquagenic Palmoplantar Keratoderma as a CFTR-related Disorder","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Acta Derm Venereol","date":"March 30, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27026144","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11298,"authors":"Errichetti  E & Piccirillo A","articleTitle":"Aquagenic Keratoderma Treated with Tap Water Iontophoresis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Indian J Dermatol","date":"March-April, 2015","volume":"60(2)","pages":"212","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11299,"authors":"Uyar B","articleTitle":"Aquagenic Syringeal Acrokeratoderma","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Indian J Dermatol","date":"November, 2014","volume":"59(6)","pages":"632","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
