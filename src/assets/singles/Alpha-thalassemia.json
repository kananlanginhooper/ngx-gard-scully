Hb Bart syndrome, the more severe form, is characterized by fetal onset of generalized edema, pleural and pericardial effusions, and severe hypochromic anemia, in the absence of ABO or Rh blood group incompatibility. Additional clinical features include marked hepatosplenomegaly, extramedullary erythropoiesis, hydrocephalus, and cardiac and urogenital defects. Death usually occurs in the neonatal period. HbH disease is characterized by microcytic hypochromic hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, mild jaundice, and sometimes thalassemia-like bone changes. Individuals with HbH disease may develop gallstones and experience acute episodes of hemolysis in response to oxidant drugs and infections.","Disease__c":"Alpha-thalassemia","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C0002312","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
