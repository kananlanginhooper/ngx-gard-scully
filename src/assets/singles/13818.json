SPLIS is caused by genetic changes (mutations) of the sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase 1 gene (<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SGPL1\" target=\"_blank\">SGPL1</a></em>) and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern [15422]. SPLIS is diagnosed based on the symptoms, clinical examination, and through genetic testing. There is no specific treatment for SPLIS [15423]. Medication and supportive care can help with some of the symptoms. The long-term outlook for people with these disorders is unknown.","dateModified":"2019-12-09T10:12:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13320,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of&nbsp;Sphingosine phosphate lyase insufficiency syndrome (SPLIS)?","answerText":"<p>Although the age of onset is not the same for everyone, the signs and symptoms of sphingosine phosphate lyase insufficiency syndrome (SPLIS) usually appear in infancy or early childhood.
