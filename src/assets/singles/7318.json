Symptoms of increased intracranial pressure include headache or nausea and vomiting. Vision problems are not common initially, but may include short flickers of gray vision, blurred or double vision, and decreased field of vision or ability to see colors. Both eyes are usually affected. Papilledema by definition is caused by increased cranial pressure. Diagnosis includes a thorough eye exam by an <a href=\"https://www.aapos.org/terms/conditions/132\" target=\"_blank\">ophthalmologist</a>.
