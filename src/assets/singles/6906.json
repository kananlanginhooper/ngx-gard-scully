Light chains are used to make <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002223.htm\" target=\"_blank\">antibodies</a> that the body needs to fight infection. People with LCDD make too many light chains, which get deposited in many body tissues. While LCDD can occur in any organ, the kidneys are always involved. Signs and symptoms of LCDD may include <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003580.htm\" target=\"_blank\">protein in the urine</a>; decreased kidney function; and/or <a href=\"http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/nephrotic/\" target=\"_blank\">nephrotic syndrome</a>. Rarely, a person with LCDD may have symptoms from cardiac (heart) or liver involvement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe underlying cause of LCDD is unknown. It is often associated with <a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/cancer/multiplemyeloma/detailedguide/multiple-myeloma-what-is-multiple-myeloma\" target=\"_blank\">multiple myeloma</a>. LCDD may progress to multiple myeloma, or it may be present with multiple myeloma when it is first diagnosed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe goal of treating LCDD is to slow the production of light chains and their damage to organs. Treatment may include <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002324.htm\" target=\"_blank\">chemotherapy</a> with a drug called <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a607007.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bortezomib</a>; <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=270733\" target=\"_blank\">autologous stem cell transplantation</a>; immunomodulatory drugs; and/or kidney transplant.
