People with XLP have an increased risk of infection because their body cannot properly regulate the number of immune system cells (<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=lymphocyte\" target=\"_blank\">lymphocytes</a>) and blood cells. The  symptoms associated with XLP vary from person to person, and even among family members. In most cases, symptoms begin anywhere from 6 months of age to 10 years of age.[14614] XLP generally has two subtypes, which are caused by mutations in different genes:[14615][5298]\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li id=\"ctrlQuestionManager_RadEditor2\"><strong>XLP1</strong> is mainly characterized by an inappropriate immune response to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/epstein-barr/about-ebv.html\" target=\"_blank\">Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection</a>, leading to <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6589/hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis\" target=\"_blank\">hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis</a> (HLH) or severe <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/epstein-barr/about-mono.html\" target=\"_blank\">mononucleosis</a>; dysgammaglobulinemia; and lymphoproliferative disease (malignant lymphoma).</li>\r\n    <li id=\"ctrlQuestionManager_RadEditor2\"><strong>XLP2</strong> is usually characterized by HLH (often associated with EBV), dysgammaglobulinemia, and <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315\" target=\"_blank\">inflammatory bowel disease</a>&nbsp;(colitis). People with XLP2 have not been known to develop lymphoma.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p id=\"ctrlQuestionManager_RadEditor2\">Signs and symptoms of HLH include fever, enlarged lymph nodes and spleen, skin rashes, and problems with the lungs, digestive system, liver, and nervous system.[5298][14867] The heart, kidneys, or other organs may also be affected.[5298] Mononucleosis may cause fatigue; fever; an inflamed and sore throat; enlarged lymph nodes, liver, and spleen; and symptoms of anemia.[14614][14868] Dysgammaglobulinemia causes an increased risk of recurrent infections.[5298]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nXLP1 is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SH2D1A\" target=\"_blank\">SH2D1A</a></em> gene, and XLP2 is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/XIAP\" target=\"_blank\">XIAP</a></em> gene. Inheritance is X-linked recessive. However, in rare cases, females with a mutation on one copy of the responsible gene develop symptoms of XLP.[5298] A diagnosis of either type of XLP can be confirmed with genetic testing.[14615] Of note, there have been males with mutations known to cause XLP that have not developed symptoms.[14615]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe only cure for XLP is <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/allogeneic-stem-cell-transplantation\" target=\"_blank\">allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation</a>, which should be considered as early as possible. Treatment of XLP-related HLH may include immunosuppressive agents (such as steroids and <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/etoposide\" target=\"_blank\">etoposide</a> or <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/antithymocyte-globulin-rabbit-intravenous-route/description/drg-20061948\" target=\"_blank\">anti-thymocyte globulin</a>), and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a607038.html\" target=\"_blank\">rituximab</a> when HLH is associated with EBV infection. Hypogammaglobulinemia is treated with <a href=\"https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions-dictionary/immunoglobulin-(IgG)-replacement-therapy\" target=\"_blank\">IVIG replacement therapy</a>, and lymphoma is treated with standard chemotherapy. Inflammatory bowel disease is treated with immunosuppression.[14615]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWithout treatment, many people with XLP do not survive beyond childhood, usually due to HLH.[5298] The average age of death for males has been reported as 11 years (with a range of 2-69 years) for XLP1, and 16 years (with a range of 1-52 years) for XLP2.[14615]</p>","dateModified":"2018-08-09T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":12809,"questionText":"How might X-linked lymphoproliferative disease be treated?","answerText":"X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome treatment requires the coordinated effort of a team of specialists, such as a pediatrician or internist, immunologist, hematologist, and oncologist.[14614] Because XLP can cause life-threatening conditions, it is important to identify males with XLP as soon as possible. Close monitoring (such as of EBV viral loads, IgG levels, blood counts, liver tests, inflammatory marker, coagulation studies as needed) is a very important aspect of care. <span>&nbsp;</span>Treatment will vary depending on a variety of factors, including the severity of a person&rsquo;s symptoms. [14614][14616] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf a person is identified before EBV exposure, regular infusions with immunoglobulins (IgG replacement therapy) may be recommended to help prevent life-threatening infectious mononucleosis and the onset of other symptoms and findings potentially associated with XLP.[14614]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf a person with XLP is diagnosed after EBV exposure, treatment may include therapies to help prevent opportunistic infections associated with XLP, such as antibiotic medications, intravenous gammaglobulin therapy, and rituximab (to deplete B-cells harboring EBV).[14616][14614] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople with XLP are at risk for <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6589/hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis\">hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis</a> (HLH). HLH is<br />\r\na condition in which the body makes too many activated <a href=\"http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/immuneSystem/Pages/immuneCells.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">immune cells</a> (macrophages and lymphocytes). Treatment of HLH may include a combination of strong immune suppressing medications followed by a <a href=\"https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/stem-cells.html\">stem cell transplant</a>.[14614][14615][14616] Studies on new treatments for HLH have been completed in recent years (e.g., anti-thymocyte globulin), and others are underway (Toculizumab, Novimmune NI-0501, and Ruxolitinib).[14615] It is hoped that new medications will improve success rates and long term outlook for people with HLH who undergo stem cell transplant. <span>&nbsp;</span><br />\r\n<br />\r\nBone marrow or stem cell transplant is currently the only definitive treatment for XLP1. A tailored discussion regarding the risks and benefits of transplant for each individual patient is critical.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome people with XLP have developed B-cell lymphoma. The lymphoma may be treated with surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Genetic counseling should be offered to people with XLP and their families. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStudies investigating novel treatments, such as SLAM family inhibitors, gene editing, and gene therapy, have been underway.[14616] Improvements in gene therapy techniques have resulted in better outcomes and less risk for adverse reactions. Gene therapy clinical trials may soon prove this approach to be a viable alternative to stem cell transplant.[14616] <strong></strong>","dateModified":"2018-05-10T19:42:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":14614,"authors":"","articleTitle":"X linked Lymphoproliferative Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Organization for Rare Disorders","date":"2007","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/x-linked-lymphoproliferative-syndrome/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14615,"authors":"Zhang K, Wakefield E, Marsh R","articleTitle":"Lymphoproliferative disease, X-linked","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"June 30, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1406/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14616,"authors":"Panchal N, Booth C, Cannons JL, Schwartzberg PL","articleTitle":"X-Linked Lymphoproliferative  Disease Type 1: A Clinical and Molecular Perspective","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Front Immunol","date":"Apr 4 2018","volume":"9:666","pages":"","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5893764/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":5107,"relatedDiseaseName":"T cell immunodeficiency primary","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
