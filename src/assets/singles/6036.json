The overactive protein may cause inflammation in the bones of the jaw, triggering the production of too many <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/1481.htm\" target=\"_blank\">osteoclasts</a>&nbsp;(the cells that repair bone). Too many of these cells contribute to the abnormal breakdown of bone tissue in the upper and lower jaw. A combination of bone loss and inflammation likely leads to the cyst-like growths seen in cherubism.[2210]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout 80% of people with cherubism have a mutation in &nbsp;the <em>SH3BP2</em> gene.
