A 2005 case report described a successful pregnancy in a woman being treated with biotin for biotinidase deficiency throughout her pregnancy. Her laboratory studies (plasma acylcarnitine profile and urine organic acids) were normal when analyzed during the pregnancy. The pregnancy was uneventful and her infant was healthy after birth and was developmentally normal at 3 months of age.[9417] We are not aware of studies that discuss women with biotinidase deficiency who are untreated during pregnancy.
