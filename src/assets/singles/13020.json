When the two types concur it is called the combined type.  Microcystic lesions are commonly found inside the mouth, throat, and in the tongue, <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/swollen-parotid-gland\">parotid gland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.parotidsurgerymd.com/education/articles/parotid-salivary-gland-info/\">submandibular gland</a>. Symptoms include deformity, and problems with breathing and feeding.[11907] The exact cause is unknown but is likely related to a malformation of the lymphatic system at six to ten weeks of gestation, when some lymphatic tissue fails to communicate with the lymphatic and venous system. Treatment depends upon the clinical presentation, the size of the lesion, the  location, and resulting complications. Superficial mucosal microcystic lesions may be treated with <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001913.htm\">laser therapy</a>.[11906][11907]<br />","dateModified":"2016-07-22T16:59:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":9789,"relatedDiseaseName":"Lymphatic malformations","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
