In some children, the brain damage will happen without a triggering fever. Damage to the basal ganglia will make it hard for the child to control the movements of their body. The damage cannot be reversed. However if treatment is started in a newborn with GA1 before symptoms begin, 80-90% of people with GA1 will not develop symptoms.
