Normally the blood is filtered in a glomerulus and the waste and extra fluid is passed into a connected tubule to become urine. However, the majority of kidney biopsies from people with LPHS also find red blood cells in the tubules, suggesting at least some of the glomeruli are damaged or abnormal, causing them to be leaky. It is not clear however why sometimes the kidney biopsies do not find red blood cells in the tubules.
