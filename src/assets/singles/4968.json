Each type is associated with a different underlying genetic cause. SHFM1 has been linked to chromosome 7, and SHFM2 is linked to the X chromosome. SHFM3 is caused by a duplication of chromosome 10 at position 10q24. Changes (mutations) in the TP63 gene cause SHFM4. SHFM5 is linked to chromosome 2, and SHFM6 is caused by mutations in the WNT10B gene. SHFM may be inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=209\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked</a> manner.","dateModified":"2014-01-22T17:07:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
