The trapped blood then creates a blockage which interferes with blood flow to the heart. Depending on the degree of blockage, symptoms can range from chest pain to heart attack or <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/cardiacarrest.html\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">cardiac arrest</a>. [10738][10739] For some, the first symptom is a heart attack. If the blockage is partial, symptoms may include shortness of breath, a rapid heartbeat, sweating, nausea, and fatigue (tiredness). [10738][10743] Though SCAD can occur at any age, most cases occur in otherwise healthy people between the ages of 30 and 50. It is more common in women. [10738][10740] SCAD is an urgent situation and requires immediate attention. [10740][10739] Though the exact cause of SCAD is not fully understood, risk factors include pregnancy, recently giving birth, very high blood pressure, and extreme exercise. [10738][10740][10739] Certain conditions such as connective tissue disorders or <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/2326/fibromuscular-dysplasia/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">fibromuscular dysplasia (</a>FMD) may also increase a person&rsquo;s risk of developing SCAD. [10738][10739] Treatment depends on the signs and severity of the disease but may include allowing the dissection to heal on its own, medications to reduce the risk of clots, or <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/angioplasty/\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">percutaneous coronary intervention</a>. Some cases require surgery. [10738][10744][10739] People who have survived SCAD may be at risk for another dissection.
