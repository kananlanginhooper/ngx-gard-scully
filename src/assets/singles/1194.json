It may occur with a variety of congenital syndromes, metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative disorders; therefore signs and symptoms may depend upon the associated condition an affected individual has.[5695] The most common findings are developmental and speech delay, poor muscle tone (hypotonia), <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/ataxia\" target=\"_blank\">ataxia</a> and abnormal ocular (eye) movements. Cerebellar hypoplasia may range from mild or partial underdevelopment to complete absence (agenesis).
