These are some of the building blocks of protein. Because the body cannot effectively break down these amino acids, which are found in many protein-rich foods, individuals experience nausea and vomiting after ingesting protein.&nbsp;Symptoms usually develop after infants are weaned and begin to eat solid foods. Without treatment, other signs and symptoms associated with protein intolerance may also occur, including short stature, muscle weakness, impaired immune function, and weak brittle bones (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/osteoporosis.html\" target=\"_blank\">osteoporosis</a>).
