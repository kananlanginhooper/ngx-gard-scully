Most cases of Alexander disease begin before age 2 years (the infantile form). Symptoms of the infantile form include an enlarged brain and head, seizures, stiffness in the arms and/or legs, intellectual disability, and delayed physical development. Less frequently, onset occurs later in childhood (the juvenile form) or adulthood. Common problems in juvenile and adult forms of Alexander disease include speech abnormalities, swallowing difficulties, and poor coordination.[532][533] Alexander disease is caused by mutations in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GFAP\" target=\"_blank\"><em>GFAP</em></a> gene. While this condition is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> fashion, most cases result from new mutations in the gene.[532]","dateModified":"2015-12-29T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":5336,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Alexander disease?","answerText":"The symptoms of Alexander disease vary depending on the form of the condition (neonatal, infantile, juvenile, and adult).
