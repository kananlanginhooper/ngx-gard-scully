The signs and symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), larger-than-normal liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), and problems of the heart.[5243]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are four major types of the condition. Each type has a different cause and the additional signs and symptoms mentioned below:[13088]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/2000/congenital-dyserythropoietic-anemia-type-1/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">Type 1</a></strong>: Characterized by moderate to severe anemia; jaundice; hepatosplenomegaly; and iron overload, which can lead to heart problems, liver disease (cirrhosis), and diabetes. Some people  are born with skeletal defects of the fingers and/or toes. In&nbsp;some cases, the disease can be detected before birth as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007308.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hydrops fetalis</a>.&nbsp;It is usually caused by changes (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/GlossaryS/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\"></a><a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">mutations</a>) in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CDAN1\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">CDAN1</a></em>&nbsp;and <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/C15orf41\" target=\"_blank\">C15orf41</a></em>(less frequently) genes.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Type 2</strong>: Characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, gallbladder stones, and a milder form of anemia. After 20 years of age, some affected people develop iron overload. It is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SEC23B\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">SEC23B</a></em> gene&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Type 3</strong>: The rarest form of the types. The liver is unaffected, but eye and blood problems (<a href=\"https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=134&amp;ContentID=121\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">monoclonal gammopathy</a>) are present. The exact cause of this type is currently unknown but it likely results from mutations in a gene located on the long arm of <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/15#ideogram\" target=\"_blank\">chromosome 15</a> at a position designated 15q22. </li>\r\n    <li><strong>Type 4</strong>: Characterized by very severe anemia. It is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/KLF1\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">KLF1</a></em> gene.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTypes 1 and 2 are inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">autosomal recessive</a>  manner.

Type 4 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
