Ammonia, which is formed when proteins are broken down in the body, is toxic if the levels become too high. The nervous system is especially sensitive to the effects of excess ammonia. Argininosuccinic aciduria usually becomes evident in the first few days of life. An infant with argininosuccinic aciduria may be lacking in energy (lethargic) or unwilling to eat, and have poorly controlled breathing rate or body temperature. Some babies with this disorder experience seizures or unusual body movements, or go into a coma. Complications from argininosuccinic aciduria may include developmental delay, intellectual disability, progressive liver damage, skin lesions, and brittle hair. The condition is caused by mutations in the <span class=geneSymbol><em><a href=\"http://www.ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ASL\" target=_blank>ASL</a></em></span> gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=_blank>autosomal recessive</a> pattern.[3379]&nbsp;Long-term management&nbsp;includes dietary restriction of protein and supplementation with arginine.
