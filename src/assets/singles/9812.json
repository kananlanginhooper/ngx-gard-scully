T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia causes a slow increase in white blood cells called T lymphocytes, or T cells, which originate in the lymph system and bone marrow and help to fight infection.&nbsp;This disease usually affects people in their sixties. Symptoms include anemia; low levels of platelets (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000586.htm\" target=\"_blank\">thrombocytopenia</a>)&nbsp;and infection-fighting neutrophils (<a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/neutropenia/MY00110\" target=\"_blank\">neutropenia</a>) in the blood; and an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003276.htm\" target=\"_blank\">enlarged spleen</a>.
