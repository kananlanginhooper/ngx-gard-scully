The amount of extra genetic material and which genes are duplicated varies in each person depending on the size and location of the duplication.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nScientists suspect that the features seen in people affected by this condition are caused by the duplication and/or disruption&nbsp;of certain genes found on Xq. The consequences of over-expression of many of the genes located&nbsp;in this region&nbsp;are not well understood. However, there are three specific genes that are fairly well characterized. The duplication of a particular gene, <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MECP2\" target=\"_blank\"><em>MECP2</em></a>, may be responsible for many of the signs and symptoms found in affected people. An extra copy of the <em>MECP2</em> gene is often associated with moderate to severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, weak muscle tone in infancy, feeding difficulties, and/or frequent respiratory infections. An extra copy of the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PLP1\" target=\"_blank\">PLP1</a></em> gene&nbsp;can be&nbsp;associated with brain abnormalities that are often seen in a group of genetic disorders called <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/leukodystrophies.html\" target=\"_blank\">leukodystrophies</a> (rare diseases that affect the cells of the brain).&nbsp;Duplication of the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/OPHN1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>OPHN1</em></a> gene has been reported in people with severe intellectual disability, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003272.htm\" target=\"_blank\">microcephaly</a>, and usual facial features.

A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the condition is located on the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/X\" target=\"_blank\">X chromosome</a>, one of the two sex chromosomes (the Y chromosome is the other sex chromosome). In males (who have only one X chromosome), a duplication of Xq in each&nbsp;cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a duplication of&nbsp;Xq typically does not cause any signs or symptoms. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn many cases, the chromosome Xq duplication is inherited from a mother who has no signs or symptoms of the duplication. The X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes (the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/Y\" target=\"_blank\">Y chromosome</a> is the other sex chromosome). Males have an X chromosome and a Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. Early in the development of females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly and permanently inactivated in each cell (called <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=504\" target=\"_blank\">X-inactivation</a>). X-inactivation prevent female cells from having twice as many functional X chromosomes as males. Because X-inactivation is usually random, the X chromosome inherited from the mother is active in some cells, and the X chromosome inherited from the father is active in other cells. However, when a female has an X chromosome with a duplicated copy of Xq, the abnormal chromosome is often preferentially inactivated in many or all cells. This is called \"skewed X-inactivation.\"&nbsp;It prevents some women with a chromosome Xq duplication from developing features of the duplication since the extra genetic material is not active.[8410][8411] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome cases of chromosome Xq duplication are not inherited and occur due to a random event during the formation of the egg or sperm, or in early fetal development.[8408] When this happens, it is called a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/de-novo-mutation/\" target=\"_blank\">de novo</a> duplication (occurring as a new genetic change for the first time in the affected person).","dateModified":"2015-03-01T15:26:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[{"referenceId":8407,"authors":"Cheng SF, Rauen KA, Pinkel D, Albertson DG, Cotter PD","articleTitle":"Xq chromosome duplication in males: clinical, cytogenetic and array CGH characterization of a new case and review","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Am J Med Genet A","date":"June 2005","volume":"135(3)","pages":"308-313","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15887264","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8408,"authors":"Armstrong L, McGowan-Jordan J, Brierley K, Allanson JE","articleTitle":"De novo dup(X)(q22.3q26) in a girl with evidence that functional disomy of X material is the cause of her abnormal phenotype","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Am J Med Genet A","date":"January 2003","volume":"116A(1)","pages":"71-76","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12476455","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8410,"authors":"Sanlaville D, Schluth-Bolard C, Turleau C","articleTitle":"Distal Xq duplication and functional Xq disomy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet J Rare Dis","date":"February 2009","volume":"4","pages":"4","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19232094","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8411,"authors":"","articleTitle":"X chromosome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"January 2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/X","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":8381,"questionText":"How is chromosome Xq duplication diagnosed?","answerText":"There are several different specialized tests that can be used to diagnose a chromosome Xq duplication.
