Described features include&nbsp;tall stature, a large head (macrocephaly), deep palmar creases, and distinct facial features. These features include a port-wine birthmark on the forehead (glabellar nevus flammeus), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), arched eyebrows, prominent eyes, a broad nasal tip and minor ear abnormalities.
