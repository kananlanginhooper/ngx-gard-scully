During an episode of TGA, a person is not able to make new memories. The person may be disoriented in regard to time and place, but can remember who they are and can recognize family members. TGA typically lasts for several hours, but can last up to ten hours. Since no memories are made during a TGA episode, the person will never remember what happened during this period, but all other memory is usually intact. Most people have only one episode of TGA during their lifetime. The underlying cause of TGA is unclear. There is no specific treatment for TGA as it usually resolves on its own.[10544][10546][12488]","dateModified":"2016-10-31T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":11259,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of transient global amnesia?","answerText":"The signs and symptoms of tansient global amnesia (TGA) have been clearly defined by the medical community:[10544][12488][10555]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The main sign of TGA is being temporarily unable to form new memories. This is called prominent anterograde amnesia. During the episode of TGA, the person will seem&nbsp;disoriented in time and often ask questions about the date or their environment over and over again. This may be described as the person sounding like a \"broken record.\"&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>During the TGA episode, the person may forget memories from the recent past (retrograde amnesia). The period of memory loss varies and may extend back hours to days or weeks, but only in rare instances, years.</li>\r\n    <li>Other cognitive functions (ability to think) are not affected.

For example, reflexes, balance and coordination are normal.</li>\r\n    <li>The TGA episode lasts between 1 and 10 hours (6 hours is the average).
