CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. This excess fluid causes an abnormal widening of spaces in the brain called ventricles (ventriculomegalia) and can create a harmful pressure on brain tissue.[3463] Symptoms of hydrocephalus vary and may include an unusually large head with thin, transparent scalp, bulging forehead with increased spaces between the bones of the skull (fontanelles), and a downward gaze. Other symptoms may include seizures, abnormal reflexes, slow heartbeat and respiratory rate, headaches, vomiting, irritability, weakness, and visual problems.[3463][11570][14305]&nbsp; <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is caused by genetic and non-genetic factors. The most common cause of congenital hydrocephalus are variations (mutations) in the&nbsp; <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/L1CAM\" target=\"_blank\"><em>L1CAM</em></a> gene, where there is a&nbsp;narrow passageway between the third and fourth ventricles (aqueductal stenosis). Other causes include mutations in many other genes, brain and/or spinal cord malformations, infections, bleeding inside the cavities of the brain (intraventricular hemorrhage), trauma, exposition to certain drugs (teratogens) or a congenital tumor of the brain.[3463][14305] Congenital hydrocephalus can be an isolated malformation or be part of a syndrome where there are other associated malformations.[3463] It is most often treated by surgically inserting a <a href=\"http://nhfonline.org/treatment-of-hydrocephalus.htm\" target=\"_blank\">shunt system</a>&nbsp;to transport the excess CSF and allow for re-absorption. If left untreated, blindness and continuing mental deterioration may occur.[3463][11570][14305]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<p>Hydrocephalus may be subdivided according to the particular defect that exists in the brain and whether the cerebrospinal fluid pressure is high or normal:[3463][14306]</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Communicating hydrocephalus is when there is no blockage (obstruction) in the ventricules but the fluid is not absorbed readily, or there is too much fluid&nbsp; to be absorbed.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Noncommunicating (obstructive) hydrocephalus is when there is a blockage of the CSF causing widening (dilation) of the pathways that are located upstream of the block, resulting in an increased&nbsp; pressure inside the brain.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span>There are also 2 other forms of hydrocephalus that usually affect only adults:[3463][14306]</span><br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\r\n    <li><span>Normal-pressure hydrocephalus is  where the ventricules are expanded but the pressure inside the nervous system is normal.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n    <li><span>Hydrocephalus ex-vacuo occurs when stroke or traumatic injury cause damage to the brain and the brain tissue may shrink.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span>Hydrocephalus may also be classified in congenital or acquired. Acquired hydrocephalus develops at the time of birth or at some point afterward and may be caused by injury or disease.[3463][11954]</span>","dateModified":"2018-01-30T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":2767,"relatedDiseaseName":"Hydrocephalus autosomal recessive","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":434,"relatedDiseaseName":"Hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
