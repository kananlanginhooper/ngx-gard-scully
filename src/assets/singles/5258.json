The condition is characterized by chronic diarrhea that begins during the first six months after birth. Continued diarrhea can lead to an inability to gain weight (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000991.htm\" target=\"_blank\">failure to thrive</a>). Trichohepatoenteric syndrome also causes liver disease such as <a href=\"http://www.liverfoundation.org/abouttheliver/info/cirrhosis/\" target=\"_blank\">cirrhosis</a> (chronic liver damage) or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003275.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hepatomegaly</a> (swollen liver).[13003] Affected individuals may have wooly or patchy hair. Tirchohepatoenteric syndrome is caused by mutations in <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TTC37\" target=\"_blank\">TTC37</a></em>or <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SKIV2L\" target=\"_blank\">SKIV2L</a> </em>and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

The hair of people who have trichohepatoenteric syndrome may be wooly, patchy, or brittle. The hair may easily fall out due to each strand of hair having many thickened points surrounded by weak points (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001449.htm\" target=\"_blank\">trichorrhexis nodosa</a>).[9918] Trichohepatoenteric syndrome is also characterized by liver disease such as cirrhosis (chronic liver damage) or hepatomegaly (swollen liver). The intestinal problems associated with the condition are most characteristic of the disease. These problems include chronic diarrhea beginning in the first 6 months of life.[9917]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther symptoms associated with trichohepatoenteric syndrome include characteristic facial features such as widely spaced eyes, a broad nose, and a wide forehead.[9918] People with trichohepatoenteric syndrome may also have a weakened <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/immunesystem.html\" target=\"_blank\">immune system</a> that makes it more difficult to fight infection. Some people may have skin abnormalities such as lightly-colored spots (<a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/911900-overview\" target=\"_blank\">caf&eacute;-au-lait macules</a>), dry skin (<a href=\"http://www.healthline.com/health/xerosis\" target=\"_blank\">xerosis</a>), or skin that has a rubbery texture.[9917] Less commonly, some people with trichohepatoenteric syndrome have been born with heart abnormalities.
