Symptoms can include a red skin rash around the eyelids, red bumps around the joints, and muscle weakness in the arms and legs. Dermatomyositis is most common in&nbsp;adults between ages 40 and 60, or in children between ages 5 and 15. Muscle weakness gets worse over time and can lead to stiff joints and muscle wasting. The cause for dermatomyositis is unknown. Diagnosis is made through a clinical exam and microscopic examination of a piece of skin and muscle. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms.&nbsp;Options include different medications, physical therapy, and exercise.[15650][15651][15652][15653]<br />","dateModified":"2020-06-11T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":2697,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of dermatomyositis?&nbsp;","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with dermatomyositis.
