People with this condition have an extra piece of genetic material (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/duplication/\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">duplication</a>) on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/16\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">chromosome 16</a> at a location designated p13.3. The symptoms and severity vary from person to person because not everyone with a 16p13.3 duplication has the same amount of extra DNA. Possible symptoms include developmental delay, speech delay, joint abnormalities, characteristic facial features, attention deficit,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/a-parents-guide-to-autism-spectrum-disorder/index.shtml\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">autism spectrum disorders</a>, and underlying health problems such as heart conditions. Most cases are not inherited and occur randomly. Less commonly, the duplication is inherited from a parent. Regardless, a person with the duplication can pass it on to his/her child. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.[10223][10224]","dateModified":"2017-06-12T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
