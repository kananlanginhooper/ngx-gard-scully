The condition can range from mild to severe and many affected people may have no obvious signs or symptoms. Approximately 5-10% of infected people will have severe disease with watery diarrhea and vomiting leading to rapid fluid loss, dehydration, and shock. If left untreated, this can cause acute renal failure, severe electrolyte imbalances, coma, or even death. People develop cholera when they eat food or drink water that is contaminated with <em>Vibrio cholera</em>. The condition occurs most often in places that lack water treatment and have poor sanitation and inadequate hygiene. Treatment aims to prevent dehydration and replace the fluids and salts that are lost through diarrhea.[11186][11187][11188]","dateModified":"2016-04-07T20:10:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
