Some features of the condition may vary among affected people.[8890]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll people with NCBRS have intellectual disability. In most cases it is severe, but in some cases it may be moderate or mild. Language is particularly limited, with at least 30% of affected people never developing speech. Major motor milestones such as sitting and walking are usually not very delayed. People with NCBRS are often happy and friendly, but may have temper tantrums or periods of aggression. Some people have some symptoms of <a href=\"http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/a-parents-guide-to-autism-spectrum-disorder/index.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">autism spectrum disorder</a>. <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003200.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Epilepsy</a> occurs in about 2/3 of affected people. The type of seizures that occur can vary.[8890]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFacial characteristics are usually not recognized in younger affected people. They may include a triangular-shaped face; prominent eyelashes; a nose with a broad base, thick nostrils, and upturned tip; a broad <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/9012.htm\" target=\"_blank\">philtrum</a>; and wide mouth. The palpebral fissures (width of the eyes) are sometimes narrow and/or downslanting. As people with NCBRS age, the amount of subcutaneous fat tissue tends to decrease, making the skin below the eyes sagging and wrinkled, especially at the cheeks when smiling. However, some affected people retain full cheeks. Facial characteristics typically become more pronounced with increasing age. In some affected adults, the lower third of the face becomes markedly broad.[8890]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSparse scalp hair is a major feature of NCBRS and is present in almost all affected people. It often gradually worsens with age, but in some people it improves over time. Skin is usually wrinkled and more noticeable in the distal limbs. Teeth may be widely spaced, and eruption of teeth (baby or adult) may be delayed. While the hands and feet usually appear normal at birth, the interphalangeal joints become prominent in the majority of affected people. Bone age can vary, and osteoporosis is not uncommon.[8890]","dateModified":"2015-05-14T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":8890,"authors":"Sousa SB, Hennekam RC; Nicolaides-Baraitser Syndrome International Consortium","articleTitle":"Phenotype and genotype in Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Am J Med Genet C Semin Med Genet","date":"September, 2014","volume":"166C(3)","pages":"302-314","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":8756,"questionText":"What causes&nbsp;Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome?","answerText":"Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome (NCBRS) is caused by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>&nbsp;in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SMARCA2\" target=\"_blank\">SMARCA2</a></em> gene, which is located on the small arm of chromosome 9.
