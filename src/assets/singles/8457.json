This protein exists in cell membranes where it binds to another protein called tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The binding sends signals that tell the cells to trigger inflammation (producing immune system proteins) or self-destruct.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost <em>TNFRSF1A</em> gene mutations that cause TRAPS result in incorrectly-shaped TNFR1 proteins, which become trapped in cells and cannot reach the surface to bind with TNF. The trapped proteins then clump together and are thought to trigger other pathways involved in causing inflammation. Affected people typically have a mutation in only one of their 2 copies of the <em>TNFRSF1A</em> gene, so some normal TNFR1 proteins are still produced, leading to even more inflammation. This is what leads to excess inflammation in people with TRAPS. It is unclear if abnormalities in the cells' ability to self-destruct also plays a role in causing the features of TRAPS.[9159]","dateModified":"2015-06-25T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":9159,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"August, 2011","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated-periodic-syndrome","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":1511,"questionText":"How is tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) inherited?<br />","answerText":"TRAPS is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner.
