People with Tay-Sachs disease do not have enough of an enzyme called beta-hexosaminidase A.&nbsp; The less enzyme a person has, the more severe the disease and the earlier that symptoms appear. There are 3 forms of Tay-Sachs disease, distinguished by the general age of onset:[14280][14281]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Infantile</strong> - the most common severe form, with symptoms appearing in the first few months of life. Symptoms include a loss of skills learned (regression), seizures, and loss of muscle and mental functions. Children with this form do not survive past early childhood.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Juvenile</strong> - a form with a range of severity, with symptoms appearing any time during childhood (but usually between ages 2 and 5). Symptoms include behavior problems, gradual loss of skills, frequent respiratory infections, and seizures. People with this form typically do not survive past their teenage years.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Late onset/adult</strong> - the least severe form, with symptoms appearing in late childhood to adulthood. Symptoms may include clumsiness, muscle weakness, psychiatric disorders, and gradual loss of skills, often leading to the need for mobility assistance. Intellect and behavior become impaired in some cases. The lifespan varies from shortened to unaffected.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTay-Sachs disease is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HEXA\" target=\"_blank\">HEXA</a></em> gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive. The <em>HEXA</em> gene gives the body instructions to make part of the&nbsp;beta-hexosaminidase A enzyme, which is needed to break down a substance called GM2 ganglioside. When the enzyme is not functional or not made, GM2 ganglioside builds up in the nerve cells (neurons) of the brain and spinal cord, causing the symptoms of the disease.[61]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe diagnosis of Tay-Sachs disease involves a blood test that detects absent or very low levels of beta-hexosaminidase A enzyme activity. Molecular genetic testing of the <em>HEXA</em> gene may be used to identify the specific mutations present, or to rule out the disease if a false-positive blood test result is suspected.[14284]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrently there is no cure for Tay-Sachs disease, and there are no therapies that slow the progression of the disease. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms and increase quality of life. For example, children with seizures may be treated with anti-seizure medicines. Adequate nutrition and hydration are recommended, to prevent complications.[14284][14285]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Note: You may also find Tay-Sachs disease referred to as a</em> <a href=\"https://www.ntsad.org/index.php/research-for-families/an-introduction-to-research/lysosomal-storage-disorders\" target=\"_blank\">lysosomal storage disease</a><em> or a </em><a href=\"https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/951943-overview\" target=\"_blank\">GM2-gangliosidosis</a> <em>because the disease involves a lysosomal enzyme and the buildup of GM2 ganglioside.</em>","dateModified":"2018-01-22T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":96,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease?","answerText":"The first symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease may appear from infancy to adulthood, depending on how much beta-hexosaminidase A enzyme activity a person has (if any).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the most common form, the <strong>infantile form</strong>, infants have no enzyme activity, or an extremely low level (less than 0.1%). They typically appear healthy in the newborn period, but develop symptoms within 3 to 6 months of age. The first symptom may be an exaggerated startle response to noise. Infants with this form begin to lose milestones such as rolling and sitting (regression) and develop muscle weakness, which gradually leads to paralysis. They also lose mental functions and become increasingly unresponsive to their surroundings. By 12 months of age, they begin to deteriorate more rapidly, developing blindness, seizures that are hard to treat, and difficulty swallowing. Infants with this form of Tay-Sachs disease typically do not survive past 4 years of age. The most common cause of death is complications from lung inflammation (bronchopneumonia).[14280][14281][14285]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <strong>juvenile form</strong> is less common and is characterized by having very little  enzyme activity, typically less than 1% of normal activity. Depending on exactly how much activity there is, symptoms may begin any time during childhood, most commonly between ages 2 and 5.&nbsp; Children with this form often develop frequent infections, behavioral problems, and have more slowly progressive loss of movement control, speech, and mental function. They may also begin to have seizures and lose their vision. Children with the juvenile form often spend several years having no responsiveness or awareness before passing away in late childhood or adolescence. Infection is a common cause of death.[14280][14281][14285]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <strong>late onset form</strong>, sometimes called the adult or chronic form, is also less common and is characterized by having less than 10% of normal enzyme activity. Symptoms and severity vary more among people with this form. Symptoms may begin in childhood to adulthood, but the disease is often not diagnosed until adolescence or adulthood. Neurological impairment is slowly progressive and may lead to clumsiness and loss of coordination, muscle weakness, <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Tremor-Fact-Sheet\" target=\"_blank\">tremors</a>, difficulty speaking or swallowing, and uncontrollable muscle spasms and movements. Many people eventually need mobility assistance. In some people with this form, the first obvious symptom is a severe psychiatric disorder such as <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/index.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">schizophrenia</a>. Impaired intellect or dementia may or may not develop.

People with Tay-Sachs disease do not have enough of an enzyme called beta-hexosaminidase A.&nbsp; The less enzyme a person has, the more severe the disease and the earlier that symptoms appear. There are 3 forms of Tay-Sachs disease, distinguished by the general age of onset:[14280][14281]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Infantile</strong> - the most common severe form, with symptoms appearing in the first few months of life. Symptoms include a loss of skills learned (regression), seizures, and loss of muscle and mental functions. Children with this form do not survive past early childhood.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Juvenile</strong> - a form with a range of severity, with symptoms appearing any time during childhood (but usually between ages 2 and 5). Symptoms include behavior problems, gradual loss of skills, frequent respiratory infections, and seizures. People with this form typically do not survive past their teenage years.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Late onset/adult</strong> - the least severe form, with symptoms appearing in late childhood to adulthood. Symptoms may include clumsiness, muscle weakness, psychiatric disorders, and gradual loss of skills, often leading to the need for mobility assistance. Intellect and behavior become impaired in some cases. The lifespan varies from shortened to unaffected.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTay-Sachs disease is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HEXA\" target=\"_blank\">HEXA</a></em> gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive. The <em>HEXA</em> gene gives the body instructions to make part of the&nbsp;beta-hexosaminidase A enzyme, which is needed to break down a substance called GM2 ganglioside. When the enzyme is not functional or not made, GM2 ganglioside builds up in the nerve cells (neurons) of the brain and spinal cord, causing the symptoms of the disease.[61]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe diagnosis of Tay-Sachs disease involves a blood test that detects absent or very low levels of beta-hexosaminidase A enzyme activity. Molecular genetic testing of the <em>HEXA</em> gene may be used to identify the specific mutations present, or to rule out the disease if a false-positive blood test result is suspected.[14284]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrently there is no cure for Tay-Sachs disease, and there are no therapies that slow the progression of the disease. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms and increase quality of life. For example, children with seizures may be treated with anti-seizure medicines. Adequate nutrition and hydration are recommended, to prevent complications.[14284][14285]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Note: You may also find Tay-Sachs disease referred to as a</em> <a href=\"https://www.ntsad.org/index.php/research-for-families/an-introduction-to-research/lysosomal-storage-disorders\" target=\"_blank\">lysosomal storage disease</a><em> or a </em><a href=\"https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/951943-overview\" target=\"_blank\">GM2-gangliosidosis</a> <em>because the disease involves a lysosomal enzyme and the buildup of GM2 ganglioside.</em>","dateModified":"2018-01-22T00:00:00","references":[{"referenceId":61,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Tay-Sachs disease","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"October 2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/tay-sachs-disease","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14280,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Tay-Sachs Disease","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Tay-Sachs and Allied Diseases Association","date":"October 14, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.ntsad.org/the-diseases/tay-sachs","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14281,"authors":"Baumann N, Turpin J","articleTitle":"Tay-Sachs disease","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet","date":"April, 2006","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=en&Expert=845","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14284,"authors":"Kaback MM, Desnick RJ","articleTitle":"Hexosaminidase A Deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"August 11, 2011","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1218/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14285,"authors":"Tegay DH","articleTitle":"GM2 Gangliosidoses","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"December 11, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/951943-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":95,"questionText":"How is Tay-Sachs disease inherited?","answerText":"Tay-Sachs disease is inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> manner.[61] This means that to have the disease, a person must have a <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a> in both copies of the responsible <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a> in each cell.

They typically appear healthy in the newborn period, but develop symptoms within 3 to 6 months of age. The first symptom may be an exaggerated startle response to noise. Infants with this form begin to lose milestones such as rolling and sitting (regression) and develop muscle weakness, which gradually leads to paralysis. They also lose mental functions and become increasingly unresponsive to their surroundings. By 12 months of age, they begin to deteriorate more rapidly, developing blindness, seizures that are hard to treat, and difficulty swallowing. Infants with this form of Tay-Sachs disease typically do not survive past 4 years of age. The most common cause of death is complications from lung inflammation (bronchopneumonia).[14280][14281][14285]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <strong>juvenile form</strong> is less common and is characterized by having very little  enzyme activity, typically less than 1% of normal activity. Depending on exactly how much activity there is, symptoms may begin any time during childhood, most commonly between ages 2 and 5.&nbsp; Children with this form often develop frequent infections, behavioral problems, and have more slowly progressive loss of movement control, speech, and mental function. They may also begin to have seizures and lose their vision.
