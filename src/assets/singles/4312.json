Other skin features may include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/naevus-anaemicus\" target=\"_blank\">nevus anemicus</a>&nbsp;(areas of lighter skin) and <a href=\"https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/cafe-au-lait-macule/\" target=\"_blank\">caf&eacute; au lait spots</a>.[14677] About half of people with PPV have systemic involvement, which means they have features affecting other areas of the body. People with systemic involvement may have neurologic, ocular (eye), or muscular abnormalities.[14677][14678] Several subtypes of PPV have been identified which are generally distinguished based on the specific type(s) of skin features present.[14679][14677]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIsolated PPV is typically a sporadic disorder that occurs for the first time in people with no family history of PPV.[14680] Researchers have found that PPV can be caused by a somatic mutation in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GNA11\" target=\"_blank\">GNA11</a></em> or <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GNAQ\" target=\"_blank\">GNAQ</a></em> gene that is present only in the affected tissues of the body. These mutations are not present in the blood or in unaffected tissues, which means the disorder is likely due to non-inherited mutations that are randomly acquired after conception. In some cases of isolated PPV, the underlying cause remains unknown.[14679]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment and long-term outlook (prognosis) of PPV largely depends whether there is systemic involvement and which body parts or organ systems are affected.[14678][14680] Isolated PPV without systemic involvement typically does not require treatment. However, large skin lesions may cause problems with body image and self-esteem, so laser treatments may be considered to improve the appearance of skin lesions.[2967][14683]","dateModified":"2018-05-30T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":4019,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of phacomatosis pigmentovascularis?","answerText":"Characteristic signs and symptoms of phacomatosis pigmentovascularis (PPV) involving the skin include <a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1084479-overview\" target=\"_blank\">port wine stain</a>&nbsp;and various pigmentary lesions (lesions that are brown, black or blue in color).

Eye conditions such as ocular melanosis (also called ocular melanocytosis) are common. Ocular melanosis refers to a blue-gray pigmentation in the white of the eye (the sclerae). This condition often occurs along with nevus of Ota and may affect one or both eyes.[2967] Complications of nevus of Ota include <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/glaucoma.html\" target=\"_blank\">glaucoma</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/melanoma.html\" target=\"_blank\">melanoma</a>, so people with nevus of Ota require careful examination and follow-up by an ophthalmologist.[2969] Other eye conditions reported in PPV include iris hamartomas, iris mammillations, and iris nodules.[2969] When neurologic abnormalities are present they usually become apparent in the first few months of life and may include developmental delay, seizures, intracranial calcifications (calcium deposits within the brain), or <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Cerebral-Atrophy-Information-Page\" target=\"_blank\">cerebral atrophy</a>.[14678] Some people with PPV also have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7706/sturge-weber-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Sturge-Weber syndrome</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/3122/klippel-trenaunay-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</a>, each of which causes various signs and symptoms.[14684]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A variety of other signs or symptoms have been reported in individual cases of PPV (e.g., </span><a href=\"http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site1257/mainpageS1257P0.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">primary lymphedema</a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">, renal angiomas, </span><a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/7064/Moyamoya_disease.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">moyamoya disease</a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">, </span><a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/scoliosis.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">scoliosis</a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">, malignant colonic polyposis, hypoplastic larynx, multiple granular cell tumors, and </span><a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001476.htm\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">selective IgA deficiency</a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">).[2970] Signs and symptoms associated with&nbsp;PPV can vary greatly from person to person and can be&nbsp;difficult to predict.</span></p>","dateModified":"2018-05-30T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":2967,"authors":"Fernández-Guarino M, Boixeda P, de Las Heras E, Aboin S, García-Millán C, Olasolo PJ","articleTitle":"Phakomatosis pigmentovascularis: Clinical findings in 15 patients and review of the literature","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Am Acad Dermatol.","date":"2008 Jan; Epub 2007 Nov 28"},{"referenceId":2969,"authors":"Chekroun-Le Du L et al.,","articleTitle":"Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis type II","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"European Journal of Dermatology","date":"1998","url":"http://www.john-libbey-eurotext.fr/en/print/e-docs/00/01/87/6B/article.phtml","dateAccessed":"2011-02-01T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":2970,"authors":"Narchi H et al.,","articleTitle":"Picture of the month","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med","date":"2001","url":"http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/155/2/191","dateAccessed":"2011-02-01T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":14677,"authors":"Galbraith S","articleTitle":"Capillary malformations (port wine stains) and associated syndromes","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"November, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/capillary-malformations-port-wine-stains-and-associated-syndromes","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"Waltham, MA","publisher":"UpToDate"},{"referenceId":14678,"authors":"Diaz LZ","articleTitle":"Vascular lesions in the newborn","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"April, 2018","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-lesions-in-the-newborn","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"Waltham, MA","publisher":"UpToDate"},{"referenceId":14684,"authors":"Sen S, Bala S, Halder C, Ahar R, Gangopadhyay A","articleTitle":"Phakomatosis pigmentovascularis presenting with sturge-weber syndrome and klippel-trenaunay syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Indian J Dermatol","date":"January-February, 2015","volume":"60(1)","pages":"77-79","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318068/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":4022,"questionText":"How might phacomatosis pigmentovascularis be treated?","answerText":"If phacomatosis pigmentovascularis (PPV) is not associated with systemic complications (e.g., Sturge-Weber syndrome, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, neurological&nbsp; problems, or eye conditions) it typically does not require treatment.
