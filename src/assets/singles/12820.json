Signs and symptoms of the condition generally develop during adulthood and include crops of pustules on one or both hands and/or feet that erupt repeatedly over time. Affected individuals may also experience itching (pruritus), pain, or a burning sensation.[9871][9989][12513] The classification of PPP is controversial. Some have proposed that PPP is a variant of psoriasis, while others believe it to be a separate disease.[9989][12514] Though the area of involvement is often limited, PPP can have a significant effect on quality of life and can interfere with walking or other daily activities.[9989][12513] PPP often has a chronic and relapsing course and may be resistant to treatment.[12514] Treatment options may include topical steroids, emollients, certain medications called retinoids, and treatment with light (phototherapy).[9989][12513][12514][12515]<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2016-11-02T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":11276,"questionText":"What causes pustulosis palmaris et plantaris?","answerText":"The cause of pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (PPP) is not fully understood, though many theories have been proposed. Some have suggested PPP may be a disorder of the sweat glands.[9871][9989] Environmental factors are believed to play a part as well. For instance, there is a strong association between smoking and PPP. Other environmental factors that may contribute to PPP include stress, infections (especially tonsillitis and sinusitis), and certain medications. Some have also suggested an association with allergies to certain metals.[9989][12515] Although most cases occur in people with no family history of the condition, more than one family member can be affected. This suggests that genetic factors may contribute to the development of the condition in some cases.
