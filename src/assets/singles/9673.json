This gene provides instructions for making a protein needed for proper formation of many organs and tissues before birth. The protein attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. Researchers believe that the ZEB2 protein is involved in the development of tissues that give rise to the nervous system, digestive tract, facial features, heart, and other organs.[3560]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMowat-Wilson syndrome almost always results from the loss of one working copy of the <em>ZEB2</em> gene in each cell. In some cases, the entire gene is deleted. In other cases, mutations within the gene lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the ZEB2 protein. A shortage of this protein disrupts the normal development of many organs and tissues, which causes the features of Mowat-Wilson syndrome.[3560]","dateModified":"2017-07-10T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":3560,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Mowat-Wilson syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"June, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/mowat-wilson-syndrome","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":7890,"questionText":"Is Mowat-Wilson syndrome inherited?","answerText":"Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is technically considered an autosomal dominant disorder, which means that one mutated copy of the  gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.

The new mutation occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development.[3560]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn very rare cases, more than one child in a family has MWS. The chance of recurrence for parents who have a child with MWS is  approximately 2% or less.
