This protein is especially important during early embryonic development since it is thought to be involved in the formation of many different&nbsp;body structures such as the pancreas, testes, brain, and muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For example, the protein helps regulate the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation) within the pancreas, testes, and muscles. In the developing brain, it plays many different roles such as assisting with the movement of neurons to their final locations. Specific changes in the <em>ARX</em> gene impair the function of the protein, which may disrupt the normal development of many different parts of the body.
