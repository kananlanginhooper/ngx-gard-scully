(2005) proposed a new classification of CAMT based on the course and outcome of the disease, as exemplified by  20 patients: CAMT type I (11 patients) was characterized by early onset of severe pancytopenia, decreased bone marrow activity, and very low platelet counts. CAMT type II (9 patients) was somewhat milder and characterized by transient increases of platelet counts up to nearly normal values during the first year of life and an onset of bone marrow failure at age 3 or later.","Disease__c":"Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C1327915","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
