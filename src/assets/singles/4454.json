While polio is a contagious disease, PPS is not.[7840] The exact cause of PPS years after the first episode of polio is unclear, although several theories have been proposed.[7842][7841] Treatment focuses on reducing symptoms and improving quality of life.[7840]","dateModified":"2014-11-05T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[{"caseId":56097,"abbreviatedInquiry":"My mother in law had post polio syndrome and my husband and my son have weakness in their legs that reminds me of post polio syndrome.

Post polio syndrome only affects people who have had polio. It usually develops 15 to 40 years after the infection.[11228]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven though the exact cause is not known, post polio syndrome most likely arises from the damage left over from having polio. The polio virus harms the nerves that control muscles, and it makes the muscles weak. Following a polio infection, people may gain back the use of their muscles, but the nerves that connect to the muscles could be damaged. The nerves may break down over time and cause another episode of weakened muscles. Researchers are studying other possible causes of post-polio syndrome. One theory is that the immune system plays a role.[11229]\r\nIn cases where there are several family members with conditions similar to post polio syndrome, it is important to see a doctor for a detailed examination and a review of the family history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ppassmn.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Post Polio Awareness &amp; Support Society of Minnesota</a>&nbsp;has <a href=\"http://www.skally.net/ppsc/myths.html\" target=\"_blank\">information in this topic</a> that you may find useful.&nbsp;","dateModified":"2016-04-12T10:50:00","references":[{"referenceId":11228,"authors":"Post-Polio Syndrome - Topic Overview","articleTitle":"","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"WebMD","date":"2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.webmd.com/brain/tc/post-polio-syndrome-topic-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11229,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Cardiolipin Antibodies","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"LabTests","date":"2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/cardiolipin/tab/sample/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":10489,"questionText":"Can poliomyelitis in pregnancy affect the fetus?","answerText":"It seems that the risk for this to happen is very low.
