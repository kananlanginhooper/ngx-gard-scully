The knee is most commonly affected, however it can affect any joint. The tumors begin as small nodules of cartilage. These nodules can separate and become loose within the joint.[3488] Some tumors may be no larger than a grain of rice.[3489] Synovial chondromatosis most commonly occurs in adults ages 20 to 50. Signs and symptoms may include pain, swelling, a decreased range of motion, and locking of the joint.[3488][3489] The exact underlying cause of the condition is unknown.[3488] Treatment may involve surgery to remove the tumor.
