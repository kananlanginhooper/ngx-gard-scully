Obesity is characteristic for PHP-1a and may be severe, while obesity is less prominent and may be absent among people with PPHP. Both PHP-1a and PPHP are caused by mutations&nbsp;that affect the function of&nbsp;the <em>GNAS</em> gene.&nbsp;But people who inherit the mutation from their <em>mother</em> develop PHP-1a; whereas those who inherit the mutation from their <em>father</em> develop PPHP.[3223]","dateModified":"2016-03-09T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":10855,"questionText":"How is pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP) diagnosed?","answerText":"Diagnosis of PPHP is based on the presence of features of <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/5770/albright-hereditary-osteodystrophy/Resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">Albright hereditary osteodystrophy</a> (AHO) without parathyroid hormone (PTH) resistance. &nbsp;If there are features of AHO and resistance to PTH a different form of <a href=\"https://mail.nih.gov/owa/GARDinfo@mail.nih.gov/redir.aspx?C=jGPCHKzk5YFtb-cQKS4eJQzfs34GiE1F-51teNJo0GRcgF8IzqnTCA..&amp;URL=https%3a%2f%2frarediseases.info.nih.gov%2fgard%2f10758%2fpseudohypoparathyroidism%2fResources%2f1\" target=\"_blank\">pseudohypoparathyroidism</a> (PHP) will be considered.
