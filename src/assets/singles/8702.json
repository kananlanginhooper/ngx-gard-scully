These clots can cause serious medical problems if they restrict or block blood flow, including <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000571.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hemolytic anemia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000586.htm\" target=\"_blank\">thrombocytopenia</a>, and kidney failure. It can occur at any age and is often caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Genetic factors involve genes that code for proteins that help control the complement system (part of your body&rsquo;s immune system). Environmental factors include certain medications (such as anticancer drugs), chronic diseases (e.g., systemic sclerosis and malignant hypertension), viral or bacterial infections, cancers, organ transplantation, and pregnancy. In about 60% of aHUS, a gene mutation may be identified. <span>The genes associated with genetic aHUS include <em><em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/C3\" target=\"_blank\">C3</a></em></em>,&nbsp;<br />\r\n</span><em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CD46\" target=\"_blank\">CD46</a></em><span>&nbsp;(</span><em>MCP</em><span>),&nbsp;</span><em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CFB\" target=\"_blank\">CFB</a></em><span>,&nbsp;</span><em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CFH\" target=\"_blank\">CFH</a></em><span>,&nbsp;</span><em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CFHR1\" target=\"_blank\">CFHR1</a></em><span>,&nbsp;</span><em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CFHR3\" target=\"_blank\">CFHR3</a></em><span>,&nbsp;</span><em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CFHR4\" target=\"_blank\">CFHR4</a></em><span>,&nbsp;</span><em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CFI\" target=\"_blank\">CFI</a></em><span>,&nbsp;</span><em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DGKE\" target=\"_blank\">DGKE</a></em><span>, and&nbsp;</span><em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/THBD\" target=\"_blank\">THBD</a>.&nbsp;</em>Mutations in these genes<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><span>increase the likelihood (predisposition)<span style=\"font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; color: #545454;\"> </span>to developing aHUS, rather than directly causing the disease.&nbsp;</span>Most cases are <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/sporadic/\" target=\"_blank\">sporadic</a>.
