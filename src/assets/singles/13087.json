Initial treatment may depend on which symptoms most impair daily living and create the most distress.[14939] It is recommended that treatment begin as soon as the diagnosis is made. Treatment may involve the following, either alone or in combination:[14939][14953][14955][14954]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Treating symptoms with psychiatric medications (when appropriate), psychotherapy (particularly <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610\" target=\"_blank\">cognitive behavioral therapy</a>), and supportive interventions (such as school accommodations, family support, and maintaining nutrition and hydration needs with restricted food or fluid intake). Some interventions may take several weeks to begin helping and may require adjustments, as symptoms frequently change during the course of the condition. The experiences of healthcare professionals who treat PANS suggest that specific symptoms of PANS (such as anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms) respond to the same medications used to treat these symptoms in people without PANS.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Treating underlying infections or sources of inflammation with antibiotics.&nbsp;An initial course of anti-strep antibiotics is recommended in all cases, even when there is not a documented infection. Some people with PANS have experienced complete and lasting remission of symptoms during treatment with antibiotics. Using antibiotics long-term to prevent infections (prophylaxis) may be recommended for children with PANDAS who have severe neuropsychiatric symptoms or recurrent strep-associated flares of symptoms.</li>\r\n    <li>Stabilizing the immune system with immunotherapy and/or anti-inflammatory therapies (in immune-related PANS).[14939] These therapies should be used only in cases where there is evidence of inflammation in the nervous system (neuroinflammation) or post-infectious autoimmunity (misdirected immune responses).[14954] Depending on symptoms and severity, therapy options may include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and intravenous immune globulin (<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-beyond-the-basics\" target=\"_blank\">IVIG</a>) or other nonsteroidal immunotherapies.[14954] Once started, immunotherapy should only continue if it is clear that symptoms are improving.[14939]&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Treatment may be tapered down or stopped completely when symptoms resolve, but may be needed again if symptoms return (when treatment is stopped or at some time later).[14939] Many people with PANS will recover completely and discontinue some or all treatments. However, others will have ongoing symptoms that require continuous treatment.[14953] If not treated, PANS can lead to permanent debilitation.[14950] </p>\r\nIn most cases, a child's primary care provider can effectively treat symptoms of PANS. Children with severe or life-threatening symptoms may need specialized treatment coordinated by a team of PANS specialists.[14939]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/13087/pans#diseaseLearnMoreSection\" target=\"_blank\">Detailed treatment recommendations for healthcare providers</a> are available and can be accessed in our Learn More section under&nbsp;Selected Full-Text Journal Articles.","dateModified":"2018-10-02T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":14939,"authors":"Swedo SE, Frankovich J, Murphy TK","articleTitle":"Overview of Treatment of Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol","date":"September, 2017","volume":"27(7)","pages":"562-565","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5610386/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14953,"authors":"Thienemann M, Murphy T, Leckman J, et al","articleTitle":"Clinical Management of Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome: Part I—Psychiatric and Behavioral Interventions","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol","date":"September 1, 2017","volume":"27(7)","pages":"566–573","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5610394/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14954,"authors":"Frankovich J, Swedo S, Murphy T, et al","articleTitle":"Clinical Management of Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome: Part II—Use of Immunomodulatory Therapies","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol","date":"September, 2017","volume":"27(7)","pages":"","url":"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/cap.2016.0148","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14955,"authors":"Cooperstock MS, Swedo S, Pasternack MS, Murphy TK","articleTitle":"Clinical Management of Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome: Part III—Treatment and Prevention of Infections","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol","date":"September, 2017","volume":"27(7)","pages":"","url":"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/cap.2016.0151","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":7312,"relatedDiseaseName":"Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with Streptococcus infections","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
