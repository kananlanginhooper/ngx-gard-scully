There are three basic patterns of polio infection: subclinical infections, nonparalytic, and paralytic.[2522] Symptoms vary based on the pattern of infection and can range from asymptomatic with subclinical poliomyelitis to partial or full paralysis. Treatment is aimed at controlling&nbsp;symptoms while the infection runs its course.&nbsp;Since the development of the polio vaccine, the <span class=\"screen_use\"><a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002387.htm\" target=\"_blank\">incidence</a></span> of the disease has been greatly reduced.[10284] The prognosis depends on the form of the disease (subclinical, nonparalytic, or paralytic) and the site affected.[2522]</p>","dateModified":"2015-12-24T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":10284,"authors":"James P.
