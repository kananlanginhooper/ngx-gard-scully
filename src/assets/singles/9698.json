An inversion involves the breakage of a chromosome in two places; the resulting piece of DNA is reversed and reinserted into the chromosome. Genetic material is typically not lost as a result of this inversion in chromosome 8, so people usually do not have any related health problems. However, genetic material can be lost or duplicated when inversions are being passed to the next generation. People with this chromosome 8 inversion are at of risk having a child with recombinant chromosome 8 syndrome.[2666]","dateModified":"2010-11-02T12:19:00","references":[{"referenceId":2666,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Recombinant 8 syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"April 2009","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/recombinant-8-syndrome","dateAccessed":"2010-11-01T00:00:00"}]},{"questionId":2567,"questionText":"How can I find a genetics professional in my area?","answerText":"To find a medical professional who specializes in genetics, you can ask your doctor for a referral or you can search for one yourself.
