People with this condition experience episodes of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000215.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cholestasis</a>, during which the liver cells have a reduced ability to release bile (a digestive fluid). Episodes generally begin in the late teens or early twenties and may be accompanied by <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000210.htm\" target=\"_blank\">jaundice</a>, severe itchiness, a vague feeling of discomfort (malaise), irritability, nausea, vomiting, and a lack of appetite. There are two forms of BRIC which are classified based on the genetic cause of the condition. BRIC1 is caused by changes (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>) in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ATP8B1\" target=\"_blank\">ATP8B1</a> gene and BRIC2 is caused by mutations in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ABCB11\" target=\"_blank\">ABCB11</a> gene.
