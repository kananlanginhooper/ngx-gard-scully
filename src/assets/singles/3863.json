This condition is one of the most common types of <a href=\"http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/attachments/National/br_1163608564.pdf\" target=_blank>T-cell lymphoma</a>. Mycosis fungoides is characterized by a scaly, red rash that develops on the skin, particularly on areas that are not usually exposed to the sun. The rash may last for months or years without causing any symptoms. Over time, a thin, reddened, eczema-like rash may develop, followed by&nbsp;thickened, red patches of skin. Finally, tumors form&nbsp;which may develop into ulcers and become&nbsp;infected. Mycosis fungoides is difficult to cure. Treatment is usually palliative, with the intention of relieving symptoms and improving the quality of life.[2950] ","dateModified":"2011-01-26T17:10:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6772,"questionText":"What is the long-term outlook for individuals with mycosis fungoides?","answerText":"Mycosis fungoides (MF)&nbsp;has an indolent (low-grade) clinical course, which means that it may persist in one stage, or may slowly progress to another stage&nbsp;(from patches to thicker plaques and eventually to tumors)&nbsp;over years or sometimes decades.[5876] The condition is incurable in most affected individuals, with the exception of those with <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/mycosisfungoides/Patient/page2#Keypoint10\" target=_blank>stage IA disease</a>.
