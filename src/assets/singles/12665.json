There are two types of classic 21-OHD CAH, the salt-wasting form and the simple-virilizing form. Symptoms include abnormal development of the external sex organs in females (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003269.htm\" target=\"_blank\">ambiguous genitalia</a>), early puberty, and short stature. The salt-wasting form also may include the inability to retain salt and water. This can lead to dehydration, low blood pressure, and a life-threatening adrenal crisis. Classic 21-OHD CAH is caused by a genetic pathogenic variant in the <em><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/cyp21a2/\" target=\"_blank\">CYP21A2</a></em> gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, blood hormone testing and may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing. Classic 21-OHD CAH can be diagnosed through a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/newbornscreening.html\" target=\"_blank\">newborn screen</a>. Treatment can prevent the more severe symptoms and may involve hormone replacement. in addition, some girls with abnormal genitalia may be offered surgery.[8036][9817][15919][15920]","dateModified":"2020-11-24T14:40:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":9228,"authors":"Merke DP","articleTitle":"Diagnosis of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"March 11, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency","dateAccessed":"2015-07-06T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15362,"authors":"Concolino P, Costella A","articleTitle":"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency: A comprehensive focus on 233 pathogenic variants of CYP21A2 gene","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Mol Diagn Ther","date":"Jun 2018","volume":"22(3)","pages":"261-280","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29450859","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15363,"authors":"Parsa AA, New MI","articleTitle":"Steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency in congenital adrenal hyperplasia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Jl Steroid Biochem Mol Biol","date":"Jan 2017","volume":"165(pt A)","pages":"2-11","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27380651","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9817,"authors":"Nimkarn A, Gangishetti PK, Yau M, New MI","articleTitle":"21-Hydroxylase-Deficient Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"Updated Feb 4, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1171/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8036,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Organization of Rare Disorders (NORD)","date":"Updated 2018","volume":"","pages":"","url":". https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15364,"authors":"Speiser PW, Arlt W, Auchus RJ, Baskin LS, Conway GS, Merke DP et al.","articleTitle":"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Jl Clin Endo Metab","date":"Nov 2018","volume":"103(11)","pages":"4043-4088","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30272171","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15919,"authors":"New M, Yau M, Lekarev O, Lin-Su K, Parsa A, Pina C, et al","articleTitle":"Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasa","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"In: Endotext [Internet].
