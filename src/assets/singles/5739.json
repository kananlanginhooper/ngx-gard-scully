The aplasia cutis may involve only the skin or include the skull under the skin. The terminal transverse limb defects may include webbed fingers or toes (syndactyly) and short or missing fingers or toes (brachydactyly or oligodactyly, respectively). Other signs and symptoms may include additional skeletal abnormalities of the limbs; <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/6228/cutis-marmorata-telangiectatica-congenita/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita</a> (a blood vessel disorder); <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000112.htm\" target=\"_blank\">pulmonary hypertension</a>; heart defects; and neurological problems.[10228] Severity can vary greatly among people with the syndrome and may be lethal in some cases.[10230] AOS is caused by mutations in any of six known <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">genes</a>.

In most cases, a person inherits the mutated gene from a parent with the syndrome. In other cases, the mutation is sporadic, which means that it occurs for the first time in a person with no family history of AOS. When a person with an autosomal dominant form of AOS has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the disease-causing mutation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen AOS is caused by mutations in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DOCK6\" target=\"_blank\"> <em>DOCK6</em></a> or <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/EOGT\" target=\"_blank\">EOGT</a></em> gene, the syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[10228] This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell.
