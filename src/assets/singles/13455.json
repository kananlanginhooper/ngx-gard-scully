Esophageal spasms are divided in 2 main types, diffuse esophageal spasm  and hypertensive peristalsis or nutcracker esophagus. Jackhammer esophagus is the most serious manifestation of the hypertensive type and it is also known as hypercontractile peristalsis.[14292] Contractions (spasms) are very intensive (very high amplitude), involve most of the esophagus, and last for a long time. There is a jackhammer-type appearance on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/4952-esophageal-manometry-test\">high-resolution manometry</a>, an exam which measures the  muscle contractions that occur in the esophagus when swallowing.[14292][14293][14294] Symptoms may include feeding difficulty (dysphagia) and chest pain that might be confused with a heart attack.[14293]The cause is unknown but it may occur with, or as a consequence of, other conditions, especially <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/symptoms-causes/syc-20361940\" target=\"_blank\">gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)</a>. Treatment depends on the frequency and severity of the esophageal spasms. It may include medication, Botox injections, and surgical procedures. Very hot or cold liquids, loud noises, and stress may worsen dysphagia. Jackhammer esophagus can progress to <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/achalasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352850\" target=\"_blank\">achalasia</a>, a rare and serious condition that makes it very difficult for food and liquid to pass  into the stomach.[14292][14295]&nbsp;</span><br />","dateModified":"2018-01-25T16:41:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
