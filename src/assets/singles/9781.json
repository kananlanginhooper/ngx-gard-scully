In males (who have only one X chromosome), a duplication of the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MECP2\" target=\"_blank\">MECP2</a></em> gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn females (who have two X chromosomes), a duplication of one of the two copies of the gene usually does not cause the disorder. Early in the normal development of females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly and permanently inactivated in each cell (called <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=504\" target=\"_blank\">X-inactivation</a>). This prevents females from having twice as many active X chromosome genes. Because this process is usually random, the X chromosome inherited from the mother is active in some cells, and the X chromosome inherited from the father is active in other cells. However, when a female has an X chromosome with a duplicated copy of the <em>MECP2</em> gene, the abnormal chromosome is often the one inactivated in many, or all, cells.

This prevents females from having twice as many active X chromosome genes. Because this process is usually random, the X chromosome inherited from the mother is active in some cells, and the X chromosome inherited from the father is active in other cells. However, when a female has an X chromosome with a duplicated copy of the <em>MECP2</em> gene, the abnormal chromosome is often the one inactivated in many, or all, cells.
