AVMs most commonly affect the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) but can involve any organ. Those affecting the face, head or neck are often called <strong>extracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)</strong>. Although present at birth, AVMs may not be clinically evident until childhood or adolescence. Complications may include disfigurement, destruction of tissue, obstruction of vital structures, pain, bleeding, ulceration and rarely, cardiac overload. AVMs may be treated with surgery, embolization, or both. The goal of treatment is to control rather than cure the underlying problem.[7309]","dateModified":"2014-03-27T14:42:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":7309,"authors":"Liu AS, Mulliken JB, Zurakowski D, Fishman SJ, Greene AK","articleTitle":"Extracranial arteriovenous malformations: natural progression and recurrence after treatment","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery","date":"2010","volume":"125(4)","pages":"1185-1194","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20335868","dateAccessed":"2014-03-27T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
