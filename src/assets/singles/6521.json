When the protein is missing, the cells cannot take in the glucose and galactose needed by the body.[12665]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiagnosis of glucose-galactose malabsorption (GGM) is made by the early onset of severe diarrhea, ruling out infections, and the improvement of symptoms when glucose and galactose are avoided. The diagnosis can be confirmed by <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetictesting.html\" target=\"_blank\">genetic testing</a>. Treatment involves a fructose based formula and a continued diet low in foods with glucose and galactose. Many children are able to tolerate more glucose and galactose as they near adulthood, although why this happens is not understood.[12665] People with GGM (even during infancy and childhood) are at an increased risk of developing <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/kidneystones.html\" target=\"_blank\">kidney stones</a>&nbsp;or more widespread deposits of calcium within the kidneys.
