Babies born with NLS usually grow poorly during pregnancy (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001500.htm\">intrauterine growth restriction</a>). At birth, they may be small (low birth weight and short in length) and their facial features are usually different and distinct. The babies may have a small head (microcephaly), sloping forehead, and widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism). Babies with NLS may also have extra fluid (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/edema.html\" target=\"_blank\">edema</a>) in their hands and feet, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/brainmalformations.html\" target=\"_blank\">brain abnormalities</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003297.htm\" target=\"_blank\">rigid, stiff muscles</a>. Other birth defects may affect the baby's arms, legs, skin, genitals, kidneys, and heart. Not every baby with NLS will have every sign or symptom of NLS.[12974][12975][12976][12977]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNeu Laxova syndrome (NLS) is caused by changes or mutations in one of three different genes, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PHGDH\" target=\"_blank\">PHGDH</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PSAT1\" target=\"_blank\">PSAT1</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PSPH\" target=\"_blank\">PSPH</a></em>. The mutations cause too little <a href=\"http://www.serine.org/backgroundnon.htm\" target=\"_blank\">L-serine</a> (an amino acid) to be made. There must be a mutation in both copies of one of these genes, which means NLS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. NLS can be diagnosed both prenatally by an ultrasound or after birth. The diagnosis is suspected by signs and symptoms, but may be confirmed by genetic testing (prenatally by <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003406.htm\" target=\"_blank\">chorionic villi sampling</a> (CVS) or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003921.htm\" target=\"_blank\">amniocentesis</a>; after birth by genetic blood test).[12974][12975][12976][12977] There is no cure or treatment for NLS at this time, but L-serine supplementation may prove to be an effective treatment in the future if the NLS is found early during a pregnancy.[12976][12977]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2017-01-29T23:06:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":11559,"questionText":"What causes Neu Laxova syndrome?","answerText":"Neu Laxova syndrome (NLS) can be caused by mutations in three different genes, <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PHGDH\" target=\"_blank\"><em>PHGDH</em></a><em>, <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PSAT1\" target=\"_blank\">PSAT1</a>, </em>and<em>  <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PSPH\" target=\"_blank\">PSPH</a></em>.

L-serine has important functions in the body. Since L-serine is an amino acid, it is one of the building blocks used to make many different proteins our body needs. It is also used to make other important compounds needed throughout our body and helps the brain develop normally.[12974][12975][12976] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNeu Laxova syndrome (NLS) can be considered as part of a group of diseases known as &ldquo;serine biosynthesis defects&rdquo;.[12974] Serine biosynthesis defects result from different mutations in the PGDH, PSAT, or PSPH genes that lead to <a href=\"http://www.guiametabolica.org/sites/default/files/Triptico_DefSerina_EN_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">serine deficiency</a> throughout the whole body (systemic). The serine biosynthesis diseases include:[12975][12977]\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Neu-Laxova syndrome - the most severe form</li>\r\n    <li>Infantile serine biosynthesis deficiency - intermediate form with <a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/iugr.html\" target=\"_blank\">growth deficiency</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Microcephaly-Information-Page\" target=\"_blank\">small head</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/brainmalformations.html\" target=\"_blank\">brain malformations</a>, severe <a href=\"http://www.parentcenterhub.org/repository/dd/\" target=\"_blank\">developmental delay</a>, and severe <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/neurologicdiseases.html\" target=\"_blank\">neurological problems</a> including <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/seizures.html\" target=\"_blank\">seizures</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003297.htm\" target=\"_blank\">stiff and rigid muscles</a> (affects ability to move and develop speech).</li>\r\n    <li>Childhood serine biosynthesis disease - the mildest form with normal growth and brain development, milder developmental delay, and seizures.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe difference between NLS and the other related syndromes is the amount of working protein that is made. In the case of NLS, the mutations in the genes do not allow very much working protein to be made at all. In other words, &nbsp;because of the mutation, one of the enzymes needed to make L-serine is almost completely inactive, so very little L-serine can be made in the body.[12977]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnderstanding that the symptoms of these diseases are caused by having too little L-serine is very important for future treatment, because giving L-serine before the neurological damage happens may be prove to be an effective therapy.[12976][12977]","dateModified":"2017-01-27T17:05:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":12974,"authors":"Darouich S, Boujelbene N, Kehila M, Chanoufi MB, Reziga H, Gaigi S & Masmoudi A","articleTitle":"Neu-Laxova syndrome: Three case reports and a review of the literature","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Ann Pathol","date":"August, 2016","volume":"36(4)","pages":"235-244","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27475004","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12975,"authors":"Schanze D, Kariminejad A, Nordgren A, Kariminejad MH, Conner P, Grigelioniene G, Nilsson D, Nordenskjöld M, Wedell A, Freyer C, Wredenberg A, Wieczorek D, Gillessen-Kaesbach G, Kayserili H, Elcioglu N, Ghaderi-Sohi S, Goodarzi P, Setayesh H, van de Vorst M, Steehouwer M, Pfundt R, Krabichler B, Curry C, MacKenzie MG, Boycott KM, Gilissen C, Janecke AR, Hoischen A, & Zenker M","articleTitle":"Neu-Laxova Syndrome Is a Heterogeneous Metabolic Disorder Caused by Defects in Enzymes of the L-Serine Biosynthesis Pathway","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"American Journal of Human Genetics","date":"September 4 2014","volume":"95(3)","pages":"285-293","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4157144/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12976,"authors":"El-Hattab AW, Shaheen R, Hertecant J, Galadari HI, Albaqawi BS, Nabil A & Alkuraya FS","articleTitle":"On the phenotypic spectrum of serine biosynthesis defects","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Inherit Metab Dis","date":"May, 2016","volume":"39(3)","pages":"373-81","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26960553","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12977,"authors":"El-Hattab AW","articleTitle":"Serine biosynthesis and transport defects","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Mol Genet Metab","date":"July 2016","volume":"118(3)","pages":"153-9","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27161889","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":6320,"questionText":"How is Neu-Laxova syndrome inherited?","answerText":"Neu-Laxova syndrome (NLS)&nbsp;is inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>&nbsp;manner.
