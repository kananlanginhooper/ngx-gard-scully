Eye irritation often occurs in response to various stimuli such as bright lights, wind or fatigue. As the frequency of muscle spasms and contractions increases, it may become progressively harder for affected people to keep their eyes open.[8326]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOromandibular dystonia is characterized by involuntary and often forceful contractions of the jaw and tongue, which can make it hard to open or close the mouth. Some people may have clenching of the teeth, displacement of the jaw, grimacing, chin thrusting, or repeated pursing of the lips. Eyelid and facial muscle tone may gradually decline.[8326]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople with Meige syndrome may also have spasms of the tongue and throat, which can result in the tongue protruding from the mouth and difficulty swallowing.

The prognosis likely depends on several factors, such as age of onset; rate of progression; muscles affected; how early treatment is started; and how a person responds to treatment. Some affected people improve over time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first symptoms of Meige syndrome may occur anywhere from about 30 to 70 years of age, but they most often occur in the sixth decade of life.[8335] <a href=\"https://www.nei.nih.gov/health/blepha\" target=\"_blank\">Blepharospasm</a> (<a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dystonias/detail_dystonias.htm\" target=\"_blank\">dystonia</a> of the eyelids) is the most frequent initial complaint of affected people.[8336]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn most cases, dystonia begins focally. Over time, it may spread to other muscles of the body. When dystonia spreads, it most commonly spreads to areas immediately next to affected muscles. For example, blepharospasm typically spreads to the lower face and jaw muscles. Rarely, dystonia can spread to more distant muscles in the arms and legs.[8338]&nbsp;The chance for dystonia to spread is thought to be highest within the first 3 years after onset. However, it can spread more than a decade later. Overall, people with initial onset of blepharospasm have at least a 50% lifetime risk of dystonia spreading.[8338]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne study found that on average, affected people show gradual worsening of involuntary movements for a little over 2 years, followed by movements slowly improving. The authors of this study suggested that factors that may contribute to a better prognosis include younger age of onset; shorter time between initial onset and progression to the worst symptoms; mild involuntary movements when the symptoms were the worst; and shorter time between onset and starting treatment.[8337]","dateModified":"2015-02-18T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Prognosis","references":[{"referenceId":8334,"authors":"Czyz CN, Burns JA, Petrie TP, Watkins JR, Cahill KV, Foster JA","articleTitle":"Long-term botulinum toxin treatment of benign essential blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, and Meige syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Am J Ophthalmol","date":"July, 2013","volume":"156(1)","pages":"173-177","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23541393","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8335,"authors":"Møller E, Werdelin LM, Bakke M, Dalager T, Prytz S, Regeur L","articleTitle":"Treatment of perioral dystonia with botulinum toxin in 4 cases of Meige's syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod","date":"November, 2003","volume":"96(5)","pages":"544-549","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8336,"authors":"Reese R, Gruber D, Schoenecker T, Bäzner H, Blahak C, Capelle HH, Falk D, Herzog J, Pinsker MO, Schneider GH, Schrader C, Deuschl G, Mehdorn HM, Kupsch A, Volkmann J, and Krauss JK","articleTitle":"Long-term clinical outcome in meige syndrome treated with internal pallidum deep brain stimulation","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Mov Disord","date":"March, 2011","volume":"26(4)","pages":"691-698","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21312284","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8337,"authors":"Kamitsukasa I, Yamada T, Tokumaru Y, Hirayama K","articleTitle":"[Clinical features and factors related to the functional prognosis in Meige's syndrome]","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Rinsho Shinkeigaku","date":"March, 1995","volume":"35(3)","pages":"231-236","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8338,"authors":"Mark S.
