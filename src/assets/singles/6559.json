Signs and symptoms include a painful rash and blistering in skin folds, such as the armpits, groin, neck, under the breasts, and between the buttocks. Secondary bacterial infections are not uncommon. Symptoms are often worse in summer months due to heat, sweating, and friction.[7394] Hailey-Hailey disease is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ATP2C1\" target=\"_blank\">ATP2C1</a>&nbsp;</em>gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner.[7395] Treatment focuses on reducing symptoms and preventing flares, and may include topical medication, laser, and other procedures.[7394][7396][7400]<sup><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6559/hailey-hailey-disease#ref_7394\"></a></sup>","dateModified":"2017-05-31T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":4988,"questionText":"How is Hailey-Hailey disease inherited?","answerText":"Hailey-Hailey disease is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner.[7395] This means that having only one mutated copy of the disease-causing gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the disease. Some people with Hailey-Hailey disease inherit the disease from a parent with the disease. Other cases are due to a new mutation in the gene and occur in people with no family history of the disease.
