Warfarin is an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/bloodthinners.html\" target=\"_blank\">anticoagulant</a> that is often prescribed to people who are at an increased risk for <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001124.htm\" target=\"_blank\">blood clots</a>. Some people with a warfarin resistance do not respond to the drug at all, while others can achieve the benefits of warfarin treatment at a high dose. In either case, affected people will still be at an elevated risk for blood clots when given the standard dose of warfarin. The metabolism of warfarin and the drug's effects in the body are <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/complexdisorders\" target=\"_blank\">complex</a> traits that are determined by several genes as well as environmental and lifestyle factors such as gender, age, weight, diet, and other medications.
