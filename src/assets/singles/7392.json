Pick bodies contain an abnormal form of a protein called tau. This protein is found in all nerve cells, but people with Pick's disease have an abnormal amount or type of this protein.[5831] Symptoms often present sometime in the 50s, though it can occur as early as age 20 or as late as age 80. The course of the disease varies from&nbsp;person to&nbsp;person.[5830] The underlying cause of Pick's disease is unknown.[5831] In some cases, the disease runs in families.
