The first three of these genes give the body instructions for making proteins involved in moving charged atoms (ions) across cell membranes. This process is important for for normal signaling between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and other parts of the nervous system. Researchers think that mutations in these genes may upset the balance of ions in neurons, affecting the release and uptake of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. The exact function of the <em>PRRT2 </em>gene is not yet understood but is also thought to play a part in controlling signals between neurons. When the genes involved in FHM do not work correctly, the signaling abnormalities between neurons lead to the development of severe headaches and auras in affected people.[7888] The genetic cause in many families with FHM remains unknown.[3605]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile SHM occurs in people with no history of the condition in their family, most cases are due to new (de novo) mutations that occur for the first time in the affected person. Some people with SHM do inherit a mutation from a parent who has the mutation but is not affected. The <em>ATP1A2</em> and <em>CACNA1A</em> genes have been found to cause SHM in addition to FHM. Many people with SHM do not have a mutation in one of these genes; however, researchers think that mutations in other, unidentified genes are also involved in the condition.[7889]","dateModified":"2014-11-18T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":3605,"authors":"Jen JC","articleTitle":"Familial Hemiplegic Migraine","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"September 2009","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1388/#fhm.Clinical_Description","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":7883,"authors":"Anne Ducros","articleTitle":"Familial or sporadic hemiplegic migraine","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet","date":"April, 2008","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=en&Expert=569","dateAccessed":"2014-11-17T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":7888,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Familial hemiplegic migraine","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"January, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-hemiplegic-migraine","dateAccessed":"2016-12-05T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":7889,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Sporadic hemiplegic migraine","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"February, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/sporadic-hemiplegic-migraine","dateAccessed":"2014-11-18T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":7920,"questionText":"Is familial or sporadic hemiplegic migraine inherited?","answerText":"The known types of familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) that are due to a mutation in the <em>CACNA1A</em>, <em>ATP1A2</em>, or <em>SCN1A</em> genes are inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner.[7890] When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated gene from the affected parent.
