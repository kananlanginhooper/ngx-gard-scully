MGUS typically does not cause any problems, although some affected people may experience numbness, tingling or weakness. In some cases, MGUS may progress over time to certain forms of blood cancer (such as <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/7108/multiple-myeloma/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">multiple myeloma</a>, <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/7872/waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">macroglobulinemia</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001308.htm\" target=\"_blank\">B-cell lymphoma</a>). MGUS is thought to be a <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/complexdisorders\" target=\"_blank\">multifactorial</a> condition that is likely associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. People with MGUS are usually monitored closely to ensure that the levels of monoclonal protein do not rise and other problems do not develop. Those with stable levels of monoclonal protein typically do not require treatment.[8867][8868]","dateModified":"2016-12-27T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
