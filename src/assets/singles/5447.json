Valproic acid, also known as valproate, is a medication that is often used to treat epilepsy, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bipolardisorder.html\" target=\"_blank\">bipolar disorder</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/migraine.html\" target=\"_blank\">migraines</a>. Many babies who are exposed to this medication during pregnancy are born healthy with normal growth and development. However, studies have found that women who take valproate during pregnancy have a greater chance of having a baby with a major birth defect or other health problem. Symptoms of FVS vary but may include characteristic facial features, <a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/spina-bifida.html\" target=\"_blank\">spina bifida</a>, congenital heart defects, cleft lip and/or cleft palate, genital abnormalities, skeletal abnormalities, and developmental delay.

Early intervention programs may also be helpful.[13293][13295][13839]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises that valproate and related products should not be taken by women for the prevention of migraine headaches during pregancy.
