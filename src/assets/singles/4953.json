These include the person's medical history, a physical examination, a neurologic examination, neuroimaging, a detailed family history, and molecular genetic testing.[7480] In a person with ataxia and a family history consistent with <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> inheritance, it is hard to find the exact diagnosis without genetic testing. This is because there is so much overlap of symptoms between all the forms of hereditary ataxia.[7480]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost labs that test for hereditary ataxias have a panel of tests that include testing for the forms that are most common and are known to be associated with specific genes and mutations. These forms may include SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA10, SCA12, SCA14, and SCA17 (these are all associated with a specific type of mutation called a repeat expansion). Many labs offer them as groups in a step-wise fashion based on how commonly they occur. Testing can also be done for other autosomal dominant forms that are not associated with repeat expansions, including SCA5.[7480] If a specific type of SCA is already known to occur in a family member based on genetic testing, a person can have testing only for that specific type of SCA.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is important to note that genetic testing may not always give a clear diagnosis, because genetic testing is not yet available for all hereditary ataxias. If a person who clearly has a hereditary ataxia has a normal genetic test result, they might have a type of SCA for which testing is not available.[7479]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople who have questions about a diagnosis of SCA and genetic testing for themselves or family members should speak with a neurologist and/or a genetics professional.","dateModified":"2014-06-13T10:14:00","resourceClassificationName":"Diagnosis","references":[{"referenceId":7477,"authors":"Cassandra L.
