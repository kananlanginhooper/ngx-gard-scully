They usually develop in a pattern over the skin known as the \"<a href=\"https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/blaschko-lines/\" target=\"_blank\">lines of Blaschko</a>,\" and most commonly occur on the arms or trunk.[14083][14084] Some people experience itching or pain where the patches occur.[14083]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLinear porokeratosis is thought be a form of  <a href=\"https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/disseminated-superficial-actinic-porokeratosis/\" target=\"_blank\">disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis</a>&nbsp;(DSAP). Researchers think that people with linear porokeratosis may have one inherited mutation in a gene that causes DSAP.[14089] It is thought that a second mutation in that gene is acquired (a somatic mutation), occurring in only some cell lines. This may cause the presence of streaks of patches, rather than more widespread patches.[14089][14084][14083]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment options depend on each person's symptoms.
