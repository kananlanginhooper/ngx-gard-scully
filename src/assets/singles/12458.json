Since 2015, CDC has managed the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hemoglobinopathies/scdc.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sickle Cell Data Collection (SCDC) program</a> in California and Georgia. SCDC allows these states to analyze the health information of individuals with SCD and identify critical gaps in their diagnosis, treatment, and access to care. CDC plans to fund up to seven recipients to participate in a rigorous course of activities to expand capacity for state-wide SCD surveillance systems. CDC plans to fund up to five recipients to engage stakeholders, participate in web-based learning sessions, assess database linkages and infrastructure, and report out on all required capacity building SCD surveillance activities. CDC also plans to fund up to two recipients to provide technical assistance.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />","url":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=315312","lastModified":"2019-06-06T11:01:00","isFeatured":false},{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
