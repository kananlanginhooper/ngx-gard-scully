Regular hiccups often develop after eating a large meal or drinking a carbonated beverage, and they typically go away on their own after a couple minutes. Chronic hiccups last over two days and in rare cases, may continue for over a month. Complications of chronic hiccups can include insomnia, fatigue, weight loss, malnutrition, and depression or anxiety. The exact underlying cause is often unknown; and over 100 different causes of chronic hiccups have been reported. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and the duration of the hiccups. Treatment of chronic hiccups varies but may include medications, acupuncture, and/or surgery.[15879][15880][15881][15882]","dateModified":"2020-11-05T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13727,"questionText":"What are the symptoms of chronic hiccups?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common symptoms and complications in people with chronic hiccups.
