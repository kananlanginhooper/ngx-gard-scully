<h1>Guides</h1>

<div style="width: 50%" class="mt-4 mb-4">
  GARD has developed guides on a variety of topics that offer tips for finding
  information, resources, and services. Each guide is based on common questions
  from our users. We divided our guides into user categories to make it easier
  to navigate the website. We encourage you to browse all of the guides because
  our users often have overlapping needs.
