Signs and symptoms may include <span>salty-tasting skin; p</span><span>ersistent coughing; f</span><span>requent lung infections; w</span><span>heezing or shortness of breath; p</span><span>oor growth; weight loss; </span><span>greasy, bulky stools; difficulty with bowel movements; and in&nbsp;</span>males,&nbsp;<a title="Fertility in Men With CF" href="https://www.cff.org/Living-with-CF/Reproductive-Health-and-Fertility/CF-and-the-Male-Reproductive-System/Fertility-in-Men-With-CF/">infertility</a>.&nbsp;Over time, mucus buildup and infections can lead to permanent lung damage, including the formation of scar tissue (fibrosis) and cysts in the lungs. CF is caused by mutations in the <a href="http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CFTR" target="_blank"><em>CFTR</em></a> gene and inheritance is autosomal recessive.[24][13438][25] Treatment aims to relieve symptoms and usually includes respiratory therapies, inhaled medicines,&nbsp;<a title="Enzymes" href="https://www.cff.org/Living-with-CF/Treatments-and-Therapies/Nutrition/Enzymes/">pancreatic enzyme supplement</a>, and nutritional supplements. Newer medications such as&nbsp;<a title="CFTR Modulators" href="https://www.cff.org/Living-with-CF/Treatments-and-Therapies/CFTR-Modulators/">CFTR modulators</a>&nbsp;have been approved for use in the United States.
