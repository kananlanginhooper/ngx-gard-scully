As the disease progresses, people become weaker and are eventually wheelchair-dependent. Death often results from respiratory failure within 2 to 10 years after the symptoms begin.[5738][13403]<br>
<br>
Most people with ALS have a sporadic (not inherited) form of ALS. It is believed that these cases are caused by an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. This means that a person may have inherited genetic changes (variants) that increase their risk to develop ALS, but the person will only develop ALS if exposed to certain environmental triggers. About 10% of the people with ALS have at least one relative with the disease and are said to have have a familial (inherited) form of the disease (FALS). Familial ALS may be caused by changes (pathogenic variants, also known as mutations) in any one of several genes and the pattern of inheritance varies depending on the gene involved. The distinction between sporadic and familial cases is not always clear.[5738][13403]&nbsp; The average age at which symptoms begin is 56 years old in the sporadic cases and 46 years old in the familial cases.[134]&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Diagnosis of ALS is based on symptoms and a variety of tests to rule out other possible medical diseases that can cause similar symptoms.[134][2687] The goal of treatment is to improve the quality of life for people with ALS, by assisting with breathing, nutrition, mobility, and communication.[13403][5739] Medications specifically approved for the treatment of ALS in the United States include <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a696013.html" target="_blank">riluzole</a> and <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a617027.html" target="_blank">edaravone</a>.[14946][14947]</span></p><div><b>Organizations: </b><ul><li><span><a href="org.url">Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Society of Canada</a></span><br><span>265 Yorkland Boulevard</span><br><span> , </span><br><!----><!----></li><li><span><a href="org.url">Les Turner ALS Foundation</a></span><br><span>5550 West Touhy Avenue</span><br><span>Skokie IL, 60077-3254</span><br><!----><!----></li><li><span><a href="org.url">Muscular Dystrophy Association - ALS Division</a></span><br><span>3300 East Sunrise Drive</span><br><span>Tucson AZ, 85718-3208</span><br><!----><!----></li><li><span><a href="org.url">The ALS Association</a></span><br><span>1275 K Street, N.W.</span><br><span>Washington, DC , 20005</span><br><!----><!----></li><li><span><a href="org.url">ALS Therapy Development Institute</a></span><br><span>300 Technology Square</span><br><span>Cambridge MA, 02139</span><br><!----><!----></li><!----></ul></div><div><b>Learn More</b><ul><li><span><a href="http://www.omim.org/105400" target="_blank">Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)</a> is a catalog of human genes and genetic disorders.
