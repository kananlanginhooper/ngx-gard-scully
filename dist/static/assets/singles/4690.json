The condition affects the retina, which is a specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. This affects the sharpness of vision. Central vision is more commonly affected. Vision often deteriorates early in life, but then usually becomes stable until late adulthood. A second decline in vision typically occurs in a man's fifties or sixties. Sometimes severe complications occur, including separation of the retinal layers (<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001027.htm\" target=\"_blank\">retinal detachment</a>) or leakage of blood vessels in the retina (<a href=\"http://www.aao.org/eyenet/article/vitreous-hemorrhage-diagnosis-treatment-2?march-2007\" target=\"_blank\">vitreous hemorrhage</a>). These can lead to blindness.&nbsp;Juvenile retinoschisis is caused by <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/RS1\" target=\"_blank\">RS1</a></em> gene. It is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002051.htm\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked recessive</a> pattern.[2067][2068] Low-vision aids can be helpful.

The <em>RS1</em> gene provides instructions for producing a protein called retinoschisin, which is found in the <a href=\"http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/eyediagram/index.asp\" target=\"_blank\">retina</a>. Studies suggest that retinoschisin plays a role in the development and maintenance of the retina, perhaps playing a role in cell adhesion (the attachment of cells together).[2068] <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>RS1</em> gene mutations lead to a reduced amount or complete absence of retinoschisin, which can cause tiny splits (schisis) or tears to form in the retina. This damage often forms a \"spoke-wheel\" pattern in the <a href=\"http://www.nei.nih.gov/health/eyediagram/index.asp\" target=\"_blank\">macula</a>, which can be seen during an eye examination. In about half of individuals, these abnormalities are seen in the area of the macula, affecting visual acuity. In the other half, the sides of the retina are affected, resulting in impaired peripheral vision.[2068] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome individuals with juvenile retinoschisis do not have a mutation in the <em>RS1</em> gene.

In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A striking characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.[2068]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one mutated copy of the gene (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a>)&nbsp;in each cell is called a <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/?id=23\" target=\"_blank\">carrier</a>.
