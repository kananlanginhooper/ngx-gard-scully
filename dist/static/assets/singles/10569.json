The condition often develops very suddenly, and is usually triggered by an infection (e.g., strep throat, bacteria infection, upper respiratory infections or other viral infections). Other triggers include injury to the skin, including cuts, burns, and insect bites, certain malarial and heart medications, stress, sunburn, and excessive alcohol consumption. Treatment depends on the severity of the symptoms, ranging from at-home over the counter remedies to medicines that suppress the body's immune&nbsp;system to sunlight and phototherapy.[5732]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2013-01-03T18:20:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6656,"questionText":"How might guttate psoriasis be treated?","answerText":"The goal of treatment is to control&nbsp;the symptoms and prevent <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002300.htm\" target=_blank>secondary infections</a>.[5732] \r\n<p>Mild cases of guttate psoriasis are usually treated at home.
