In people with this condition, extreme emotional or physical stress (i.e. intense grief, anger, surprise, illness or surgery) can lead to heart muscle failure. Signs and symptoms of the condition mimic those of a heart attack and may include sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, and an irregular heartbeat. The cause of broken heart syndrome is not completely understood. Some researchers believe that it may occur when certain hormones released during times of stress temporarily affect the heart's ability to pump blood throughout the body. Treatment is available to manage the symptoms of the condition. Fortunately, most affected people have a full and quick recovery with no permanent damage to the heart muscle.[13269][13270][13271]","dateModified":"2017-03-27T15:24:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
