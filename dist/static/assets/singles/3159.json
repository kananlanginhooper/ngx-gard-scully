There are two types of lactate dehydrogenase deficiency: <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/3160/Lactate_dehydrogenase_deficiency_type_A.aspx\" target=_blank>lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency</a> (sometimes called glycogen storage disease XI) and <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/3161/Lactate_dehydrogenase_deficiency_type_B.aspx\" target=_blank>lactate dehydrogenase B deficiency</a>. People with lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency experience fatigue, muscle pain, and cramps during exercise (exercise intolerance). People with lactate dehydrogenase B deficiency typically do not have symptoms. Lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency is caused by mutations in the <span class=geneSymbol><em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LDHA\" target=_blank>LDHA</a></em></span> gene. Lactate dehydrogenase B deficiency is caused by mutations in the <span class=geneSymbol><em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LDHB\" target=_blank>LDHB</a></em></span> gene.
