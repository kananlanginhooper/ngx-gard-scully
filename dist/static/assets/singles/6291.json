DMD occurs primarily in males, though in rare cases may affect females. The symptoms of DMD include progressive weakness and loss (atrophy) of both skeletal and heart muscle. Early signs may include delayed ability to sit, stand, or walk and difficulties learning to speak. Muscle weakness is usually noticeable in early childhood. Most children with DMD use a wheelchair by their early teens. Heart and breathing problems also begin in the teen years and lead to serious, life threatening complications. DMD is caused by genetic changes (<a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/776887\" target=\"_blank\">DNA variants</a>) in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DMD\" target=\"_blank\">DMD</a></em> gene. DMD is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern and may occur in people who do not have a family history of DMD. Diagnosis of DMD is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and the result of a biopsy to remove a small piece of muscle for examination under a microscope. The result of genetic testing may also help confirm the diagnosis. While there is no known cure for DMD, there are treatments that can help control symptoms.[7593][15533][15534][15536][15537] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecker muscular dystrophy (BMD), a milder form of muscular dystrophy, is also caused by DNA variants in the <em>DMD</em> gene.<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2020-11-02T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":1501,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).

The disorders differ in terms of the distribution and extent of muscle weakness (some forms of MD also affect cardiac muscle), age of onset, rate of progression, and pattern of inheritance.[3037][8969] The prognosis for people with MD varies according to the type and progression of the disorder. There is no specific treatment to stop or reverse any form of MD. Treatment is supportive and may include physical therapy, respiratory therapy, speech therapy, orthopedic appliances used for support, corrective orthopedic surgery, and medications&nbsp;including <a href=\"http://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/allergies-asthma/Pages/Corticosteroids.aspx?nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token\" target=\"_blank\">corticosteroids</a>, anticonvulsants (seizure medications), immunosuppressants, and antibiotics.
