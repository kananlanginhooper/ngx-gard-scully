They originate from cells that were meant to form sex cells (i.e., sperm or eggs). They are often large and have a tendency to spread more quickly than the other type of germ cell tumor&nbsp;(i.e., seminoma type). Possible early signs of this cancer include chest pain and breathing problems.[667]","dateModified":"2013-10-17T17:08:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
