Lysosomes are round structures found in the cells of the body that are full of special proteins called enzymes. Lysosomal enzymes help breakdown other proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and other substances. In Fabry disease, there is not enough of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase (alpha-GAL). Alpha-GAL helps breakdown a fatty acid called \"globotriaosylceramide\" or GL3 \". Without enough alpha-GAL, the lysosomes become filled with GL-3 and can not work well. [4005] Symptoms of Fabry disease may include episodes of pain, especially in the hands and feet, clusters of small, dark red spots on the skin called angiokeratomas, a decreased ability to <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/sweat.html\" target=\"_blank\">sweat</a> (hypohidrosis), cloudiness of the front part of the eye (corneal opacity), and hearing loss. Internal organs, such as the kidney, heart or brain, may also be affected, leading to progressive <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/kidneydiseases.html\" target=\"_blank\">kidney damage</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/heartattack.html\" target=\"_blank\">heart attacks</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/stroke.html\" target=\"_blank\">strokes</a>. Milder forms of Fabry disease may appear later in life and affect only the heart or kidneys. [4005][4006]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFabry disease is caused by certain changes (pathogenic variants, also called <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>) in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GLA\" target=\"_blank\"><em>GLA</em></a> gene. Since the <em>GLA</em> gene is located on the X chromosome, Fabry disease is inherited in an X-linked manner.[4005] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough an enzyme assay test measuring the activity of alpha-GAL can diagnose Fabry disease in males, diagnosis is usually made by genetic testing in both males and females. Treatment may include enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), pain medications, and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000087.htm\" target=\"_blank\">ACE inhibitors</a>. <a href=\"http://www.kidneyfund.org/kidney-health/kidney-failure/end-stage-renal-disease.html\" target=\"_blank\">End stage kidney disease</a> may be treated by <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/dialysis.html\" target=\"_blank\">dialysis</a> or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/kidneytransplantation.html\" target=\"_blank\">kidney transplantation</a>.[4006] Migalastat (brand name Galafold) received FDA approval in 2018 to treat some adults who have specific pathogenic variants (mutations) causing Fabry disease.

Females with a pathogenic variant in one copy of the gene can be seemingly asymptomatic, can have severe symptoms, or anything in between. A high percentage of females who have a pathogenic variant experience significant symptoms.[15404]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen a female with a&nbsp;<em>GLA</em>&nbsp;pathogenic variant (with or without symptoms) has children, each child (male or female) has a 50% chance to inherit the&nbsp;<em>GLA</em> pathogenic variant because each child will inherit one of her X chromosomes at random.[15404]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen a male with a <em>GLA </em>pathogenic variant has children, the pathogenic variant will be passed on to all of his daughters, and to none of his sons.
