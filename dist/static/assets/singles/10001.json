Early diagnosis and treatment in the absence of major complications can lead to normal growth and development.[3052] The main treatment is called salt substitution therapy (receiving sodium chloride and potassium chloride). Newborns are first given this therapy intravenously (by IV) and are later transitioned to oral therapy.[14312] Diarrhea will persist through therapy even when there is adequate salt substitution, although the relative amount of stool generally decreases with age.[14312][14313]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment for episodes of acute gastroenteritis (\"stomach flu\") in children with CCD is extremely important because they can experience rapid dehydration and loss of potassium (hypokalemia). These episodes should be treated with IV replacement of fluids and electrolytes. In adulthood, people with CCD are usually able to avoid dehydration by taking extra salt substitution.[14313]","dateModified":"2018-02-05T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":3051,"authors":"Marla J.
