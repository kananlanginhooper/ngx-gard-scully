In cases where Ollier disease is inherited, the disease may appear to skip a generation. Symptoms may be present in a grandparent, for example, but not in the parent of the affected child. This is called reduced penetrance because some people who have the mutation that causes Ollier disease do not have any symptoms.[1067]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2016-12-26T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":1064,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Ollier Disease","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)","date":"2006","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/ollier-disease/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":1066,"authors":"Silve C, Juppner H","articleTitle":"Ollier disease","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases","date":"2006","volume":"1:37","pages":"","url":"http://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1750-1172-1-37","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":1067,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Enchondromatosis, Multiple, Ollier Type","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)","date":"May 2, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://omim.org/entry/166000","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12755,"authors":"Kumar A, Jain VK, Bharadwaj M, Arya RK","articleTitle":"Ollier Disease: Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Management.","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orthopedics","date":"2015 Jun","volume":"38(6)","pages":"e497-506","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26091223","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12756,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Ollier disease","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"February 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ollier-disease","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":1775,"questionText":"What are the chances that the benign tumors found in Ollier disease will become malignant (cancerous)?","answerText":"<a href=\"http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00085\" target=\"_blank\">Enchondromas</a> in Ollier disease present a risk of malignant transformation into <a href=\"http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00395\" target=\"_blank\">chondrosarcomas</a>.[12756][12755] This transformation most commonly occurs in young adults, and thus presents at an earlier age than observed in patients with chondrosarcoma alone.
