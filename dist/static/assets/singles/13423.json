A <a href=\"https://www.newbornscreening.info/GlossaryTerms/metabolicCrisis.html\">metabolic crisis</a> is caused by having low blood sugar (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/hypoglycemia.html\">hypoglycemia</a>) and the buildup of toxic products in the blood. A metabolic crisis can occur in any person with a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/metabolicdisorders.html\">metabolic disorder</a>, and they are more likely to occur after a person has gone long periods without eating or during an illness. Most people with <em>TANGO2</em>-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias present with symptoms of a breakdown of muscle tissue (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000473.htm\">rhabdomyolysis</a>). This can cause kidney damage and symptoms include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003088.htm\">fatigue</a>, muscle weakness, and having a dark color of the urine. Other symptoms of <em>TANGO2</em>-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias include <a href=\"http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/devdel.htm\">developmental delay</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001523.htm\">intellectual disability</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/seizures.html\">seizures</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003044.htm\">hearing loss</a>, low thyroid function (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000353.htm\">hypothyroidism</a>) and trouble coordinating movements (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003198.htm\">ataxia</a>).[14467] Signs and symptoms of the disease are most likely to first occur during infancy or early childhood.[14468] The disease is most common in people who are of Caucasian or Hispanic/Latino descent.[14469] <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>TANGO2</em>-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias is caused by a genetic change (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\">mutation</a> or pathogenic variant) in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TANGO2\"><em>TANGO2</em></a> <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/gene\">gene</a>. The disease is inherited in an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002052.htm\">autosomal recessive</a> manner. The disease may be suspected in people who have a metabolic crisis, episodes of rhabdomyolysis, and arrhythmias. The diagnosis can be confirmed with <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/testing/genetictesting\">genetic testing</a>. Treatment of the disease is focused on avoiding metabolic crisis by avoiding fasting or illness. If a metabolic crisis does occur, it is important to have a plan in place so that proper treatment can occur. Other symptoms of the disease may be managed with therapies and medications.[14467]","dateModified":"2018-03-19T14:23:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
