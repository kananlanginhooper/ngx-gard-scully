","answerText":"The <em>SEPN1 </em>gene provides instructions for making a protein called \"selenoprotein N.\" This protein is part of a family of selenoproteins, which have several critical functions within cells. Selenoproteins are involved in chemical reactions, which are essential for storing and releasing energy. Proteins in this family also help process hormones produced by the thyroid. The exact function of selenoprotein N is unknown. This protein is highly active in many tissues before birth and may be involved in the formation of muscle tissue. Selenoprotein N may also be important for normal muscle function after birth, although it is active at much lower levels in adult tissues. The protein contains a region that likely allows it to bind to calcium. This region is of interest because calcium plays an important role in triggering muscle contractions, which allow the body to move.[2345] ","dateModified":"2010-04-29T13:06:00","references":[{"referenceId":2345,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Congenital fiber-type disproportion","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"2010","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/congenital-fiber-type-disproportion","dateAccessed":"2012-09-05T00:00:00"}]},{"questionId":3384,"questionText":"Are there any new therapies, medications, or supplements to cure or treat congenital fiber type disproportion?
