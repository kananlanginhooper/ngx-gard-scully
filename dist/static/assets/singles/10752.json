However, because information is scarce, more studies are needed to determine if what is currently known can be applied to other women with EB.[5377]<br><br>There do not appear to be additional&nbsp;prenatal or postnatal problems for affected women, and the skin itself does not seem to worsen during pregnancy.

The risks and benefits of the mode of delivery and the choice of anesthesia should be considered. It is thought that vaginal delivery should be the first choice if EB does not significantly affect the genital tract of the affected woman.&nbsp;Women with genital involvement may opt for delivery by&nbsp;C-section. The complications arising as a result of a C-section involve blistering and scarring at the site of excision. If a C-section is required, regional anesthesia should be considered because of the avoidance of airway manipulation.[5377]<br><br>There are few reported postnatal complications.
