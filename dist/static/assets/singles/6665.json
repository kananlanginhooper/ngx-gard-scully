The condition can also affect development of the head and face.&nbsp;There are 4 types of holoprosencephaly, distinguished by severity. From most to least severe, the 4 types are alobar, semi-lobar, lobar, and middle interhemispheric variant (MIHV).[2590] In general, the severity of any facial defects corresponds to the severity of the brain defect. The most severely affected people have one central eye (cyclopia) and a tubular nasal structure (proboscis) located above the eye. In the less severe forms, the brain is only partially divided, and the eyes usually are set close together. Other signs and symptoms often include intellectual disability and <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/pituitarydisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">pituitary gland problems</a>. Holoprosencephaly can be caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">mutations</a>&nbsp;in any of at least&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1530/table/hpe-overview.T.genes_associated_with_aut/?report=objectonly\" target=\"_blank\">14 different genes</a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=33\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">chromosome</a> abnormalities; or agents that can cause birth defects (<a href=\"http://www.chw.org/medical-care/genetics-and-genomics-program/medical-genetics/teratogens/\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">teratogens</a>). It may also be a feature of several unique genetic syndromes. In many cases, the exact cause is unknown. Life expectancy for people with this condition varies, and treatment depends on the symptoms and severity in each person.[2589][2590]","dateModified":"2018-03-09T00:00:00","references":[{"referenceId":2589,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"September 2010","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/nonsyndromic-holoprosencephaly","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":2590,"authors":"Solomon BD, Gropman A & Muenke M","articleTitle":"Holoprosencephaly Overview","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"August 29, 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1530/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":3698,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of  holoprosencephaly?","answerText":"Holoprosencephaly is classified into  into 3 main subtypes based upon the severity of the malformation: lobar, semilobar, and alobar, and a fourth subtype, known as the middle interhemispheric (MIH) variant:[10728][2590]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1530/figure/hpe-overview.F1/?report=objectonly\" target=\"_blank\">Alobar holoprosencephaly</a>&nbsp;is when there is a complete failure of the brain to divide into right and left hemispheres which results in the loss of midline structures of the brain and face as well as fusion of the cavities of the brain, known as lateral ventricles and the third ventricle (which are normally separated). Facial findings may include a single eye (cyclopia) or very closely spaced eyes&nbsp; (ethmocephaly) or absent eyes (anophthalmia), or very small eye (microphthalmia) with a tubular-shaped nose (proboscis);&nbsp; or closely spaced eyes (hypotelorism) and a flattened nose or &nbsp;cleft lip that occurs in the middle of the lip (median cleft lip) or on both sides (bilateral cleft lip).
