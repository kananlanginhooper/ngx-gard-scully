Symptoms of the deficiency include prolonged bleeding, especially after an injury or after surgery. Women with prothrombin deficiency may have heavy <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/menstruation.html\">menstrual bleeding</a>. The severity of the disease can vary, with some people experiencing severe bleeding without any known cause, and others only experiencing increased bleeding after a surgery or serious injury.[14077]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProthrombin deficiency is caused by changes (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/possiblemutations\">mutations</a><span>) </span>in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/F2\"><em>F2</em></a> <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/gene\">gene</a>. There are two types of inherited prothrombin deficiency. Type I or hypoprothrombinemia and&nbsp; type II or dysprothrombinemia. Inheritance of both types is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002052.htm\">autosomal recessive</a>.[14077][14674] Diagnosis is based on laboratory test results that are consistent with the deficiency. Treatment includes IV therapy using plasma, which is the part of the blood that contains the blood clotting factors. The blood product that is used is called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://transfusion.com.au/blood_products/components/plasma/use\">fresh frozen plasma</a>. A form of the disease that is not inherited (acquired) can be caused by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002407.htm\">vitamin K</a>&nbsp;deficiency, liver disease, or an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000821.htm\">autoimmune response</a>.

The <em>F2</em> gene provides instructions to the body to make a protein called prothrombin. Prothrombin helps the body make blood clots in response to injury. One step of the process involves prothrombin binding to <a href=\"https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=160&amp;ContentID=36\">platelets</a>, which helps the body form clots. When there are disease causing changes to the <em>F2</em> gene, not enough working prothrombin protein is made, so the body cannot form clots properly.[14077][14078]&nbsp;There are two types of inherited prothrombin deficiency, type I and type II. Type I or hypoprothrombinemia is more severe, and it is characterized by a decreased level of normally functioning protein, and therefore, by a decrease in proteinactivity. Type II or dysprothrombinemia is characterized  by normal or low-normal levels of an abnormal (dysfunctional) protein. Bleeding symptoms vary depending on the amount of residual functional activity.[14674]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn other cases, factor II deficiency is acquired.
