It is caused by a type of bacteria called <em>Haemophilus ducreyi</em>. Chancroid is characterized by a small bump on the genital which becomes a painful ulcer. Men may have just one ulcer, but women often develop four or more.&nbsp;About half of the people who are infected with a chancroid will develop enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, the nodes located in the fold between the leg and the lower abdomen. In some cases, the nodes will break through the skin and cause draining <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001353.htm\" target=_blank>abscesses</a>.
