It is part of a group of disorders known as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/leukodystrophies.html\" target=\"_blank\">leukodystrophies</a>. Leukodystrophies are diseases that affect the white matter of the brain. The white matter contains nerve fibers (<a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Know-Your-Brain#Image 6\" target=\"_blank\">axons</a>), surrounded by a type of sheath or covering called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002261.htm\" target=\"_blank\">myelin</a> (a fatty, white colored substance) that allows the transmission of impulses or communication among brain cells (neurons).&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLTBL is characterized by changes in specific parts of the brain including the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/18008.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cerebellum</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Know-Your-Brain#Image 5\" target=\"_blank\">thalamus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0024736/\" target=\"_blank\">brainstem</a>. These changes can be seen by brain imaging exams (MRI). High levels of <a href=\"https://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/lactate/tab/test/\" target=\"_blank\">lactate</a> in the blood and in the cerebral spinal fluid are also seen.[13944][13946][13947] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are basically two forms of the disease based on severity of symptoms and age of onset: [13946][13947][13948][13949]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A mild disease, with onset around 6 months of age, characterized by the loss of acquired skills (psychomotor regression), muscle stiffness (spasticity), irritability and seizures. These symptoms often improve during the toddler years.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A severe disease with symptoms that start in newborns and include brain and liver problems. Symptoms generally do not improve with age.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLTBL is caused by changes (mutations) in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/EARS2\" target=\"_blank\">EARS2</a></em> gene.[13944][13946] Mutations in this gene decrease the amount of a specific mitochondrial enzyme needed for proper mitochondrial function (mitochondria are cell structures that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use), and therefore, LTBL is also considered a type of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/mitochondrialdiseases.html\" target=\"_blank\">mitochondrial disorder</a>.[13951] It is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>  pattern.[13946] There is still no cure for this disease.
