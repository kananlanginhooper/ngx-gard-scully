Common features include extra fingers and/or toes (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003176.htm\" target=\"_blank\">polydactyly</a>),&nbsp;extra&nbsp;skin\r\nbetween the fingers or toes (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003289.htm\" target=\"_blank\">syndactyly</a>),&nbsp;an abnormal\r\ngrowth in the brain called a <a href=\"http://www.hopeforhh.org/what-is-hh/\" target=\"_blank\">hypothalamic hamartoma</a>, and a malformation of the airway known as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/bifid+epiglottis\" target=\"_blank\">bifid epiglottis</a>.[4205] The bifid epiglottis in rare cases may lead to respiratory failure. While the hypothalamic hamartoma in most cases does not cause problems, in some cases it may cause neurological problems such as seizures, growth hormone deficiency, precocious puberty, or a deficiency of many hormones (<a href=\"https://www.magicfoundation.org/Growth-Disorders/Panhypopituitarism/\" target=\"_blank\">panhypopituitarism</a>) that can result in <a href=\"http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/medical-information/cortisol-deficiency\" target=\"_blank\">cortisol deficiency</a>.&nbsp;Other symptoms of PHS may include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001147.htm\" target=\"_blank\">imperforate anus</a>, abnormalities in the kidneys, heart defects, small genitalia, lack of fingers, nail problems, cleft palate, bifid uvula, and development delay and behavioral problems.[4205][4207][4209][4210][7068][11694]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPallister-Hall syndrome is caused by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GLI3\" target=\"_blank\">GLI3</a></em>&nbsp;gene.
