The <em>MID1</em> gene provides instructions for making a&nbsp;specific <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=169\" target=\"_blank\">protein</a> called midline-1. This protein helps regulate the function of microtubules, which are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). Microtubules help cells maintain their shape, assist in the process of cell division, and are essential for the movement of cells (cell migration).[3510] The <em>MID1</em> gene is a member of a group of genes called the TRIM (tripartite motif) family. The proteins produced from this large family of genes are involved in many cellular activities. Primarily, TRIM proteins play a role in the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins. As part of its protein degrading function, midline-1 is responsible for recycling certain proteins, including&nbsp;phosphatase 2A (PP2A), integrin alpha-4 (ITGA4), and serine/threonine-protein kinase 36 (STK36). The recycling of these three proteins so they can be reused instead of broken down is essential because they are needed for normal cellular functioning. Mutations in the <em>MID1</em> gene lead to a decrease in midline-1 function, which prevents this protein recycling. As a result, certain proteins are not recycled, and they buildup in cells. This buildup impairs microtubule function, resulting in problems with cell division and migration. Researchers speculate that the altered midline-1 protein affects how the cells divide and migrate along the midline of the body during development, resulting in the features of Opitz G/BBB syndrome.[9484]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome people who have a family history of X-linked Opitz G/BBB syndrome have no detectable <em>MID1</em> mutation.

It is not yet known which deleted gene(s) within this region of chromosome 22 specifically cause the signs and symptoms of Opitz G/BBB syndrome.

In most cases, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. This is because females have two different&nbsp;X chromosomes in each <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/basics/cell\" target=\"_blank\">cell</a>, and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons, because fathers only pass a Y chromosome on to their sons (which is what makes them male).&nbsp;In some cases, an affected person inherits a <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a>  in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MID1\" target=\"_blank\">MID1</a></em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MID1\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;gene</a> from an affected parent, while in other cases, it&nbsp;may result from a new mutation (<em>de novo</em>) in the affected individual.

The <em>MID1</em> gene provides instructions for making a&nbsp;specific <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=169\" target=\"_blank\">protein</a> called midline-1. This protein helps regulate the function of microtubules, which are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). Microtubules help cells maintain their shape, assist in the process of cell division, and are essential for the movement of cells (cell migration).[3510] The <em>MID1</em> gene is a member of a group of genes called the TRIM (tripartite motif) family. The proteins produced from this large family of genes are involved in many cellular activities. Primarily, TRIM proteins play a role in the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins. As part of its protein degrading function, midline-1 is responsible for recycling certain proteins, including&nbsp;phosphatase 2A (PP2A), integrin alpha-4 (ITGA4), and serine/threonine-protein kinase 36 (STK36). The recycling of these three proteins so they can be reused instead of broken down is essential because they are needed for normal cellular functioning. Mutations in the <em>MID1</em> gene lead to a decrease in midline-1 function, which prevents this protein recycling. As a result, certain proteins are not recycled, and they buildup in cells. This buildup impairs microtubule function, resulting in problems with cell division and migration. Researchers speculate that the altered midline-1 protein affects how the cells divide and migrate along the midline of the body during development, resulting in the features of Opitz G/BBB syndrome.[9484]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome people who have a family history of X-linked Opitz G/BBB syndrome have no detectable <em>MID1</em> mutation.

A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=208\" target=\"_blank\">X chromosome</a>, one of the two <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=181\" target=\"_blank\">sex chromosomes</a>  (the other sex chromosome is the <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=210\" target=\"_blank\">Y chromosome</a>). In most cases, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. This is because females have two different&nbsp;X chromosomes in each <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/basics/cell\" target=\"_blank\">cell</a>, and males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons, because fathers only pass a Y chromosome on to their sons (which is what makes them male).&nbsp;In some cases, an affected person inherits a <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a>  in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MID1\" target=\"_blank\">MID1</a></em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MID1\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;gene</a> from an affected parent, while in other cases, it&nbsp;may result from a new mutation (<em>de novo</em>) in the affected individual.
