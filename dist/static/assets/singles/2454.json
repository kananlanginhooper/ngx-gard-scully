Genoa syndrome also appears to be associated with other skeletal abnormalities, including those of the hands, and distinctive facial features.[10716][10717][10718][10715] The underlying genetic cause of the condition is currently unknown. Some reports suggest that Genoa syndrome may be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[10716][10717] Treatment is supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.","dateModified":"2016-02-23T15:20:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
