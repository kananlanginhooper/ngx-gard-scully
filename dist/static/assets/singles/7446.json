The start of puberty depends on various factors such as family history, nutrition and gender. The cause of precocious puberty is not always known. Some cases of precocious puberty&nbsp;are due to conditions that cause changes in the body's release of hormones. Treatment involves medications that can stop the release of sexual hormones.[5708]","dateModified":"2012-12-21T13:48:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6621,"questionText":"What are the long term effects of treatment for precocious puberty?","answerText":"Several studies have looked at the long-term effects of treatment with hormone therapy on children with precocious puberty. Long-term hormone treatment has been found to be safe for the reproductive system and helpful in reaching target adult height levels.[5709] Additionally, there is little evidence suggesting that long term hormone treatment is associated with psychological or behavioral problems. More studies are needed to determine this association.[5710]","dateModified":"2012-12-21T13:47:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":5709,"authors":"Pasquino AM, Pucarelli I, Accardo F, et al.","articleTitle":"Long-term observation of 87 girls with idiopathic central precocious puberty treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs: impact on adult height, body mass index, bone mineral content, and reproductive function.","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J.
