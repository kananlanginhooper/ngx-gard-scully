The gene that tells our body how to make the enzyme is also called <em>MTHFR</em>. At least 40 <em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">rare</span> MTHFR </em>gene variants have been found in people with decreased or no working enzyme.[3151] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nVery common gene variants&nbsp;(C677T and A1298C) can cause some decrease in enzyme function.&nbsp;People with homocystinuria due to MTHFR deficiency tend to have two rare variants or sometimes a rare variant <em>and </em>a common variant. Very rarely people inherit a combination of three or four common variants from their parents (for example two C677T variants and two A1298C variants) and may also develop very high levels of homocystine in their body.&nbsp;</span><br />\r\n<br />\r\nHomocystinuria usually does not show symptoms in a newborn baby. If untreated, children  show signs and symptoms of severe homocystinuria  in infancy. Newborn screening in most states includes a screening test for homocystinuria so that newborn infants can be treated early in their lives. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, homocystinuria due to MTHFR variants can be milder, presenting in later childhood or in adulthood. Symptoms may include abnormal clotting, <a href=\"http://www.parentcenterhub.org/repository/ei-overview/#delay\" target=\"_blank\">developmental delay</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003200.htm\" target=\"_blank\">seizures</a>, intellectual disability,&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/microcephaly/microcephaly.htm\" target=\"_blank\">microcephaly</a>.[3151] Severe homocystinuria can also be caused by gene variants in other genes besides MTHFR.
