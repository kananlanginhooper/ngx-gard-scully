Signs and symptoms generally develop in adulthood and may include hearing loss and <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/ataxia/ataxia.htm\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">cerebellar ataxia</a>. Some affected people may also experience seizures, memory impairment, bladder disturbance, headaches, back pain, and/or <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007470.htm\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">dysarthria</a>. Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system is thought to be caused by bleeding into a portion of the brain called the subarachnoid space (the area between the brain and the thin tissues that cover the brain). This bleeding can have a variety of causes, such as trauma, a tumor of the central nervous system, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000779.htm\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">arteriovenous malformations</a>, or an unknown cause. Not all people who experience bleeding into the subarachnoid space go on to develop superficial siderosis of the central nervous system. Treatment varies based on the underlying cause and severity of the condition and may include surgery and/or medications.[10068][10069]","dateModified":"2015-11-20T15:43:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
