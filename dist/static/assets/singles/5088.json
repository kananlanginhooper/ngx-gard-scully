In most cases only the soft tissue is fused, but in some cases the bones of the fingers (distal phalanges) are fused. There is evidence that SD3 is caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=_blank>mutations</a> in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GJA1\" target=_blank><em>GJA1</em></a> gene, which has also been implicated in a condition called <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/7239/Oculodentodigital-dysplasia/Resources/1\" target=_blank>oculodentodigital dysplasia</a>.
