These might include <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/dizzinessandvertigo.html\" target=\"_blank\">dizziness and vertigo</a> triggered by heavy lifting, straining, coughing or loud sounds that change the middle ear or intracranial pressure, fullness in the ear, autophony (an echo or reverberation in the ear when speaking, chewing or swallowing), hearing loss, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003037.htm\" target=\"_blank\">nystagmus</a>, or oscillopsia (the apparent motion of objects that are stationary). This condition is caused by an opening (dehiscence) in the bone that overlays the superior (uppermost) semicircular canal within the inner ear. While many patients with superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome are able to tolerate their symptoms and reduce or avoid triggering stimuli, others can benefit from surgical repair of the dehiscence.[8836][8837][8838]","dateModified":"2015-05-05T11:56:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":8836,"authors":"Minor LB, Carey JP","articleTitle":"Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscence (SSCD)","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Vestibular Disorders Association","date":"","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://vestibular.org/superior-canal-dehiscence-scd","dateAccessed":"2015-05-05T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8837,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Ménière’s Society","date":"","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.menieres.org.uk/information-and-support/symptoms-and-conditions/superior-canal-dehiscence-syndrome","dateAccessed":"2015-05-05T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8838,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Superior Canal Dehiscence","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"American Speech-Language-Hearing Association","date":"","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.asha.org/PRPSpecificTopic.aspx?folderid=8589934662&section=Overview","dateAccessed":"2015-05-05T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
