These cells have traits of both nerve cells and hormone-producing cells, and release hormones into the blood in response to signals from the nervous system.[14584][14583] Because a neuroendocrine tumor arises from cells that produce hormones, the tumor can also produce hormones.[14583]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNeuroendocrine tumors can develop anywhere in the body, but most occur in the digestive tract, pancreas, rectum, lungs, or appendix.[14584][14583][14585] They can be non-cancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant).[14584] They usually grow slowly over many years, but there are fast-growing forms.[14583][14336]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are many types of neuroendocrine tumors, but most are classified as one of two main types:[14583][14585]\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/9316/carcinoid-tumor\" target=\"_blank\">Carcinoid tumors</a> - NETs that most commonly arise in the digestive tract, lungs, appendix or thymus. They can also grow in the lymph nodes, brain, bone, gonads (ovaries and testes) or skin.[14583][5150]</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/13034/pancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumor\" target=\"_blank\">Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors</a> (also called islet cell tumors) - NETs that typically arise in the pancreas, although they can occur outside the pancreas.[14646]</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p> A <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7385/pheochromocytoma\" target=\"_blank\">p</a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7385/pheochromocytoma\" target=\"_blank\">heochromocytoma</a> is another, rarer type of NET that usually develops in the <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/endocrinology/adrenal_glands_85,p00399\" target=\"_blank\">adrenal gland</a>, but can also arise in other parts of the body.[14583]</span></p>\r\n<p>Signs and symptoms depend on the tumor's type, size and location; whether it produces hormones; and whether it has spread to other parts of the body (metastasized).[14583] NETs are typically described as functional or nonfunctional. Functional NETs produce a specific set of symptoms due to the production of excess hormones, while non-functional NETs generally do not cause specific symptoms. In many cases, a person has no symptoms until the tumor spreads to the liver and/or impairs the function of an organ or system. This can make NETs very hard to diagnose.[15392]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe majority of NETs are not inherited and occur sporadically in people with no family history of NETs.[14585] However, some NETs are associated with a hereditary cancer or tumor syndrome such as <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/3829/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1\" target=\"_blank\">multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1</a> (most commonly),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7855/von-hippel-lindau-disease\" target=\"_blank\">Von Hippel-Lindau disease</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7830/tuberous-sclerosis-complex\" target=\"_blank\">tuberous sclerosis</a>, or <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7866/neurofibromatosis-type-1\" target=\"_blank\">neurofibromatosis type 1</a> (NF1). Inheritance of each of these is autosomal dominant.[14585]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment of NETs depends on many factors such as the tumor's type, location, aggressiveness, and hormone-producing capabilities; as well as whether it has metastasized.[14584] Management options may include surveillance, surgery to remove the tumor and/or surrounding tissue, and various non-surgical therapies to shrink the tumor, stop it from growing, or manage symptoms.[15395][15393][15394]</p>","dateModified":"2019-04-25T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":9316,"relatedDiseaseName":"Carcinoid tumor","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":2437,"relatedDiseaseName":"Gastro-enteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":11984,"relatedDiseaseName":"Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":9266,"relatedDiseaseName":"Merkel cell carcinoma","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":13034,"relatedDiseaseName":"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":7324,"relatedDiseaseName":"Paragangliomas 1","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":7385,"relatedDiseaseName":"Pheochromocytoma","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
