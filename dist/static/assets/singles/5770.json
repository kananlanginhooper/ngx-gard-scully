This gene is responsible for creating a subunit of a certain&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/howgeneswork/protein\" target=\"_blank\">protein</a>&nbsp;called a G protein. The G protein helps regulate the activity and production of certain hormones. It is also involved in regulating the development of bone and helps prevent the body from producing bone tissue in the wrong place. Thus, a mutation in the&nbsp;<em>GNAS&nbsp;</em>gene leads to abnormal creation of the G protein, which then leads to issues with the activity of certain hormones in the body and abnormal bone growth.[1101]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe hormone resistance that can be associated with AHO, in particular the resistance to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003690.htm\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link1 confirmation\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #337ab7; text-decoration-line: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word; hyphens: none;\">parathyroid hormone</a>&nbsp;(PTH), depends on whether the mutation is inherited from the mother or the father.
