TTP causes <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bloodclots.html\" target=\"_blank\">blood clots</a> (thrombi) to form in small blood vessels throughout the body. These clots can cause serious medical problems if they block vessels and decrease or stop  blood flow to organs such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. Complications may include neurological problems (such as personality changes, headaches, confusion, and slurred speech), fever, abnormal kidney function, abdominal pain, and heart problems. Hemolytic anemia can lead to paleness, yellowing of the eyes and skin (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/jaundice.html\" target=\"_blank\">jaundice</a>), fatigue, shortness of breath, and a rapid heart rate.[12789][12790][2588] Acquired TTP usually begins in adulthood, but can affect children.  An episode of TTP usually occurs suddenly and lasts for days or weeks, but it may continue for months. Relapses (or flareups) can occur in up to 60 percent of people who have the acquired TTP.[12790] Acquired TTP is caused when a person's body mistakingly makes antibodies that block the activity of the ADAMTS13 enzyme. THe ADAMTS13 enzyme normally helps control the activity of certain blood clotting factors. Treatment includes plasma exchange and in some cases may also include corticosteroid therapy or rituximab.[12789][12790][2588][12791]","dateModified":"2016-12-16T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":11456,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of&nbsp;thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, acquired?","answerText":"The signs and symptoms of&nbsp;thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, acquired (acquired TTP) may include:[12789][12790]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Purplish bruises on the skin or mucous membranes (such as in the mouth).

TTP  affects the central nervous system and/or gastrointestinal system in over 1/3 of cases. Kidneys may also be damaged by TTP, but severe kidney damage is no longer common.

Some doctors may also give rituximab, but others use this medication only in cases that are not responding to treatment well or are more severe. Both corticosteroids and rituximab help slow or stop the making of the antibody which is attacking the ADAMTS13 enzyme, but both medications can have serious long term side effects. PEX is recommended to be continued daily until the platelet count has returned to normal. Once the person continues to be stable, corticosteroids will be decreased over a 2-3 week period.
