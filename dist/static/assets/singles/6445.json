This condition&nbsp;leads to&nbsp;bone formation outside the skeleton (extra-skeletal or heterotopic bone) that restricts movement. This process generally becomes noticeable in early childhood, starting with the neck and shoulders and&nbsp;moving down the body and into the limbs. People with&nbsp;FOP&nbsp;are born with&nbsp;abnormal big toes (hallux valgus) which can be helpful&nbsp;in making the&nbsp;diagnosis. Trauma,&nbsp;such as a fall or invasive medical procedure, or a viral illness may trigger episodes of muscle swelling and inflammation (myositis). These flareups lasts for several days to months and often result in permanent bone growth in the injured area. FOP is almost always caused by a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a>&nbsp;at the same place in the&nbsp;<span class=\"geneSymbol\"><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ACVR1\" target=\"_blank\">ACVR1</a></span>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a> and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>&nbsp;manner.

This process generally becomes noticeable in early childhood, starting with the neck and shoulders and proceeding down the body and into the limbs.[3154]\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe formation of extra-skeletal bone causes progressive loss of mobility as the joints become affected. Speaking and eating may also become difficult as the mouth becomes affected. Over time, people with FOP may become malnourished because of the inability to eat. They may also develop breathing difficulties as a result of extra bone formation around the rib cage that restricts expansion of the lungs.[3154]\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAny trauma to the muscles of an individual with FOP (a fall or an invasive medical procedure) may trigger episodes of muscle swelling and inflammation followed by more rapid ossification in the injured area. Flare-ups may also be caused by viral illnesses such as the flu.[3154]\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople with FOP are generally born with malformed big toes. This abnormality of the big toes is a characteristic feature that helps to distinguish this disorder from other bone and muscle problems.
