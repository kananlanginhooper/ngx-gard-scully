Therefore, FCE is more likely to occur when there are more blood vessels located in and around the spinal cord. Some causes of FCE are thought to include aging, people who have fibrocartilaginous material (<a href=\"https://radiopaedia.org/articles/schmorl-nodes-1\">Schmorl nodes</a>) built up in the vertebrae, or people who have spinal cord vasculature that is present throughout adulthood.[13655]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRisk factors for FCE include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/osteoporosis.html\">osteoporosis</a> and a previous injury to the spinal cord such as a motor vehicle accident.
