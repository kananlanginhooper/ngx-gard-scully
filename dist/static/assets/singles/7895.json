A condition is X-linked if the responsible gene is located on the <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=208\" target=\"_blank\">X chromosome</a>. The X chromosome is one of the two <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=181\" target=\"_blank\">sex chromosomes</a> (the other sex chromosome is the Y chromosome). Females have two X chromosomes in each cell and males have an X chromosome and a Y chromosome in each cell. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough females have two X chromosomes, one of the X chromosomes in each cell is \"turned off\" and all of the genes on that chromosome are inactivated. Females who have a mutation in a gene on one of their X chromosomes are called carriers of the related condition. Carrier females usually do not have symptoms of the condition because usually the X chromosome with the mutated gene is turned off. Therefore, they have another X chromosome with a working copy of the gene. Sometimes, the X chromosome with the working copy of the gene is turned off, which may cause symptoms of the condition. However, females with symptoms are usually much more mildly affected than males. A male has only one X chromosome, so if he inherits a mutation on the X chromosome, he will have signs and symptoms (be affected).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMales with an X-linked recessive condition always pass the mutated gene to all of their daughters, who will be carriers.
