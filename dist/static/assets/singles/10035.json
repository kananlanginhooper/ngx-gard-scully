They typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style (gait) and hairstyle to recognize others.[13351][13364] Symptoms that may vary include whether a person can perceive facial expressions normally, or recognize objects normally.[13351] The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not yet known.[13361][13362] Familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.[13350][13362]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDevelopmental prosopagnosia differs from <em>acquired</em> prosopagnosia, in which a person develops face recognition difficulties as a result of brain injury (for example, from a stroke or trauma).[13364]","dateModified":"2017-04-24T14:53:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[{"caseId":62543,"abbreviatedInquiry":"Is developmental prosopagnosia associated with autism?","caseQuestions":[{"questionId":11806,"questionText":"Is developmental prosopagnosia associated with autism?","answerText":"Developmental prosopagnosia may be more common in people with autism spectrum disorder than in the general population.
