People with fibrosing mediastinitis have varying amounts of scar tissue in the mediastinum which may cause problems for the organs located there.[7830] For example, some affected people may develop blocked airways that can interfere with lung function. Others may have compressed blood vessels which can slow or prevent blood flow to and from the heart. The exact cause of fibrosing mediastinitis is not fully understood, but it is not inherited. Many cases are linked to a specific type of fungal infection called <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001082.htm\" target=\"_blank\">histoplasmosis</a>.[2315] Treatment depends on which structures of the mediastinum are affected, the severity of the scarring and, in some cases, the cause of the condition.[7833][7843]","dateModified":"2014-11-05T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":3346,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of fibrosing mediastinitis?","answerText":"The signs and symptoms of fibrosing mediastinitis depend on which structures of the mediastinum are affected (i.e. the heart, large blood vessels, windpipe, esophagus, and lymph nodes) and the severity of the scarring.

It is likely that fibrosing mediastinitis is a <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/complexdisorders\" target=\"_blank\">multifactorial</a> condition caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor example, one study (Peebles RS et al., 2000) found that people with <em>H. capsulatum-</em>related fibrosing mediastinitis were approximately 3 times as likely as those without this condition to carry a certain <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=4\" target=\"_blank\">genetic allele</a> called HLA-A2. \"HLA\" stands for <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/geneFamily/hla\" target=\"_blank\">human leukocyte antigen</a> which is an important part of our <a href=\"http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/immuneSystem/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">immune system</a>. Finding a link between <em>H. capsulatum-</em>related fibrosing mediastinitis and HLA-A2 is noteworthy because it suggests that an abnormal immune response is important in the development of the condition. However, HLA-A2 is very common and most people with this allele do not develop fibrosing mediatinitis. It is, therefore, likely that HLA-A2 contributes along with other genetic or environmental factors to the development of this condition.[2321]","dateModified":"2014-11-06T00:00:00","references":[{"referenceId":2321,"authors":"Peebles RS, Carpenter CT, Dupont WD, Loyd JE","articleTitle":"Medistinal fibrosis is associated with human leukocyte antigen-A2*","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"CHEST","date":"February, 2000","volume":"117(2)","pages":"482-485","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}]}],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
