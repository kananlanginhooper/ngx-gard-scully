Without treatment, progressive muscle weakness  develops in babies with SMA2 between ages 6 and 12 months. Babies with SMA2 can sit without support, however, they cannot stand or walk independently. Feeding and breathing problems also develop.[13082] SMA2 is caused by changes (pathogenic variants also called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>)&nbsp;in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SMN1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>SMN1</em></a> gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> manner.[13082][8555] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiagnosis of SMA2 is suspected by symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing. SMA has been added to the list of recommended newborn screening tests in the United States, so that it can be detected prior to symptoms developing.

In December 2016, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a617010.html\" target=\"_blank\">nusinersen</a> (Spinraza) became the first FDA approved treatment for SMA2. Continued treatment with nusinersen is allowing many babies and children with SMA2 to reach and maintain age appropriate developmental milestones, including sitting, crawling, and walking. Breathing problems, nutrition problems, and hospital admissions also decrease in general. However, response to treatment does vary. Some children with SMA2 may not respond to the nusinersen at all or may have medical complications that prevent use of the treatment.[14885][14886] Other treatments remain supportive.[14883][14884]","dateModified":"2018-08-25T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":5685,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy type 2?","answerText":"The signs and symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy type 2 (SMA II) typically become apparent between 6 and 12 months of age.
