Individuals with this disorder tend to have teeth that are weaker\r\nthan normal, which leads to wear, breakage, and loss of teeth. This damage can\r\ninclude teeth fractures or small holes (pitting) in the enamel. Dentinogenesis\r\nimperfecta can affect both primary (baby) teeth and permanent teeth. People\r\nwith this condition may also have speech problems or teeth that are not placed\r\ncorrectly in the mouth.[13217] Dentinogenesis imperfecta is caused by </span><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">mutations</a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\r\nin the </span><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DSPP\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>DSPP</em></a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> </span><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/gene\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">gene</a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> and is inherited in\r\nan </span><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002049.htm\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">autosomal dominant</a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\r\nmanner.[978]</span>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>According to the original classification, there are three\r\ntypes of dentinogenesis imperfecta:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Type I: occurs in people who have <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/1017/osteogenesis-imperfecta\">osteogenesis\r\nimperfecta</a>, a genetic condition in which bones are brittle, causing them to\r\nbreak easily.
