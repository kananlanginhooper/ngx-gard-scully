Most experts feel that fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy are separate disorders but they have many similarities&nbsp;and some experts group these disorders together. Fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy can be distinguished from each other by <a href=\"https://www.jic.ac.uk/microscopy/intro_EM.html\" target=\"_blank\">electron microscopy</a>; the 'fibrils' that characterize fibrillary glomerulonephritis are smaller and&nbsp; randomly oriented as opposed to the larger and&nbsp;organized fibrils of immunotactoid glomerulopathy which also have <a href=\"http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/cells/microtubules/microtubules.html\" target=\"_blank\">microtubule formations</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both disorders probably result from deposits derived from <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/immunoglobulins\" target=\"_blank\">immunoglobulins</a> but in most cases the cause is idiopathic (unknown).&nbsp;The signs and symptoms are similar in both diseases and may include blood (hematuria) and protein (proteinuria) in the urine, kidney insufficiency and high blood pressure. Fibrillary glomeurlonephritis is much more common than immunotactoid glomerulopathy.&nbsp; Both fibrillary glomerulonephritis and immunotactoid glomerulopathy have been associated with <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0022399/\" target=\"_blank\">hepatitis C virus infection </a>and with malignancy and autoimmune disease, but immunotactoid glomerulopathy patients have a greater predisposition to <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/basics/definition/con-20031195\" target=\"_blank\">chronic lymphocytic leukemia </a>and <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/search/search-results?q=B%20cell%20lymphomas\" target=\"_blank\">B cell lymphomas</a>. All patients should be screened for these conditions. It is also important to rule out another disease known as <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyloidosis/basics/definition/CON-20024354\" target=\"_blank\">amyloidosis</a>. When the fibrils are stained with an acid dye known as \"Congo red\" the results are negative. In amyloidosis the results are positive because the dye is absorbed by the amyloids.&nbsp;Treatment is generally determined by the severity of the kidney problems.[7311][9508]","dateModified":"2015-08-18T19:22:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12740,"relatedDiseaseName":"Fibrillary glomerulonephritis ","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12048,"relatedDiseaseName":"Immunotactoid glomerulopathy","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12739,"relatedDiseaseName":"Secondary glomerular disease","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
