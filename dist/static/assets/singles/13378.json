Specific symptoms may include seizures that start early in childhood, severe intellectual disability, poor muscle tone (hypotonia), irregular muscle contractions (<a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Chorea-Information-Page\" target=\"_blank\">chorea</a>), and involuntary  movements of the face and tongue (dyskinesia).[13882][13883] The severity of symptoms can vary. Symptoms may be triggered by strong&nbsp;<span>emotions, illness, and purposeful movements.[13883] <em>GNAO1</em> encephalopathy is caused by mutations in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GNAO1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>GNAO1</em></a> gene and inheritance is autosomal dominant.[13884][13885] Treatment aims to relieve individual symptoms and may not be effective for all people. In some cases, movement disorders have improved after the placement of a <a href=\"http://www.neurosurgery.pitt.edu/centers-excellence/epilepsy-and-movement-disorders-program/deep-brain-stimulation-movement-disorders\" target=\"_blank\">deep brain stimulator</a> (DBS) device.
