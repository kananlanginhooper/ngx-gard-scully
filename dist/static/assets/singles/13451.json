KLA involves multiple parts of the body, especially the lungs and chest. Symptoms of KLA usually start during childhood, and include shortness of breath (dyspnea) and cough due to the accumulation of fluid around the lungs (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000086.htm\" target=\"_blank\">pleural effusion</a>) and heart (<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pericardial-effusion/symptoms-causes/syc-20353720?p=1\" target=\"_blank\">pericardial effusion</a>). Other common symptoms include chest and body pain, abnormal bleeding and bruising, and soft masses under the skin. Blood collections may form under the skull (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001412.htm\" target=\"_blank\">epidural hematoma</a>).[14273] The cause for KLA is unknown and it is not thought to be inherited in families. KLA is diagnosed based on the symptoms, laboratory testing, and a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/biopsy.html\" target=\"_blank\">biopsy</a> of tumor tissue.[15399] There is no specific treatment for KLA. Treatment is based on the symptoms and treatment options may include surgical procedures to drain excess fluid and reduce the size of masses, chemotherapy medications and steroids. KLA tends to be a progressive condition that gets worse with time. The most serious complications include the build-up of fluid around the lungs and heart, and the risk for abnormal bleeding.[14277]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2019-05-01T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13310,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of kaposiform lymphangiomatosis?","answerText":"The symptoms of kaposiform lymphangiomatosis (KLA) may be different from person to person.
