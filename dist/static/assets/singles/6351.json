Rapid swelling can occur in the hands, arms, legs, and feet. People with this condition have a buildup of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in the affected fascia and muscles.&nbsp;The exact cause of this condition is unknown. Corticosteroids and other immune-suppressing medications are used to relieve the symptoms. Eosinophilic fasciitis is similar in appearance to <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000429.htm\" target=\"_blank\">scleroderma</a>.[4605] However, in contrast with systemic sclerosis,&nbsp; internal organ involvement in eosinophilic fasciitis is generally absent.
