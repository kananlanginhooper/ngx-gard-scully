Additional symptoms may include low muscle tone; delayed speech; seizures; crossed eyes (strabismus); distinctive facial features (such as <a href=\"https://elementsofmorphology.nih.gov/index.cgi?tid=f103f00fcb26b7c4\" target=\"_blank\">up-slanting palpebral fissures</a> and a wide, down-turning mouth); and mild abnormalities of the hands or feet. No internal organ abnormalities have been described.[14780][14781] This disorder is caused by pathogenic variants (mutations) in the <span><em><span><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TRIP12\">TRIP12</a></span></em></span><span>&nbsp;</span> gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, but most cases are sporadic, occurring for the first time in a person with no family history of the disorder. Treatment aims to address the symptoms present in each person.[14780]","dateModified":"2018-07-09T15:05:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
