Common signs and symptoms include abdominal pain and cramping, diarrhea, and weight loss. Other general symptoms include feeling tired, nausea and loss of appetite, fever, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000560.htm\" target=\"_blank\">anemia</a>. Complications of Crohn's disease may include intestinal blockage,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001129.htm\" target=\"_blank\">fistulas</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001130.htm\" target=\"_blank\">anal fissures</a>, ulcers, malnutrition, and inflammation in other areas of the body. Crohn's disease can occur in people of all age groups but is most often diagnosed in young adults.[91][5565] The exact cause is unknown, but is thought to be due from a combination of certain genetic variations, changes in the immune system, and the presence of bacteria in the digestive tract.[91][5565][5566]&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>Many of the major genes related to&nbsp;Crohn disease, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/NOD2\"><em>NOD2</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ATG16L1\"><em>ATG16L1</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IL23R\"><em>IL23R</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IRGM\"><em>IRGM</em></a>, are involved in immune system function. The disease is not inherited but it appears to run in some families because in about 15% of the cases the disease is present in more than one relative.[5566]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and reducing inflammation, and may include diet and medication, but some people require surgery.[91][5565] Surgery often involves removal of the diseased segment of bowel (resection), the two ends of healthy bowel are then joined together (anastomosis). In about 30% of people who have surgery for Crohn&rsquo;s disease symptoms may come back within three years and up to 60% will have recurrence within ten years.[10947]<br />","dateModified":"2018-05-11T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
