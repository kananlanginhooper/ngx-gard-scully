Tumors mainly grow on the scalp and face, but can also grow on the torso, genitals and armpits. Tumors usually first appear&nbsp;in the teens or early adulthood. The types of tumors that occur in CYLD cutaneous syndrome may include <a href=\"https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1056630-overview\" target=\"_blank\">cylindromas</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1062079-overview\">spiradenomas</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1060049-overview\">trichoepitheliomas</a>. The number of tumors increases over time, and in severe cases, tumors can cover most of the scalp. Rarely, a tumor will become cancerous. Other complications may include an increased risk to develop basal cell cancer of the salivary gland or deafness due to the growth of a tumor in the ear canal. CYLD cutaneous syndrome is caused by genetic variants in the <span class=\"geneSymbol\"><em><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/cyld\" target=\"_blank\">CYLD</a></em></span> gene and is inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> pattern. Diagnosis of CYLD cutaneous syndrome is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and microscopic exam of the tumor tissue. Results of genetic testing may help confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms, and typically involves many surgeries to remove the tumors.[15860][15861][15862][15863]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe conditions known as Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, familial cylindromatosis, and multiple familial trichoepithelioma are now recognized to be part of CYLD cutaneous syndrome.","dateModified":"2020-10-21T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13709,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of CYLD cutaneous syndrome?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with CYLD cutaneous syndrome.
