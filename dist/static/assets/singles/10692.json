When changes happen to many different parts of the body, this is called a syndrome. The literature reports up to thirteen types of&nbsp;orofaciodigital syndrome, but research is necessary to confirm and clarify all of these types. For most of the types the exact cause of the condition is unknown. <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/27529974\" target=_blank>Click here</a> to&nbsp;read this and more by visiting an&nbsp;information page on this topic developed by the National Human Genome Research Institute.[2040]<br><br>See below for a list of&nbsp;orofaciodigital syndromes.&nbsp;These types are&nbsp;defined&nbsp;by certain symptoms or characteristics in addition to the those affecting the oral cavity, facial structures, and digits.
