The osteochondromas typically become apparent during childhood or adolescence, and the number, size and location of osteochondromas varies from person to person.&nbsp;Signs and symptoms may include pain, decreased range of motion, nerve impingement, deformity, differences in limb length, short stature, and fractures. Osteochondromas of the ribs may cause complications such as a collapsed lung (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000087.htm\" target=\"_blank\">pneumothorax</a>), <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000126.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hemothorax</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pericardial-effusion/symptoms-causes/syc-20353720?p=1\" target=\"_blank\">pericardial effusion</a>.[14902][14903][3125] Osteochondromas typically grow throughout childhood and stop growing when the growth plates close.[14902] However, they do recur later on in some people.[14902] While the vast majority of osteochondromas are benign (noncancerous), they may become malignant (cancerous) in adulthood in 2% to 5% of people with HMO.[14902][14903]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost cases of HMO are caused by a mutation in the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/EXT1\" target=\"_blank\">EXT1</a></em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/EXT2\" target=\"_blank\"><em>EXT2</em></a>&nbsp;gene with autosomal dominant inheritance.[14902][3125] About 96% of females with a mutation responsible for HMO will develop osteochondromas (a phenomenon known as <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/inheritance/penetranceexpressivity\" target=\"_blank\">reduced penetrance</a>), and 100% of males will develop osteochondromas.[14902][3125]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment depends on the locations and sizes of osteochondromas and the severity of symptoms they cause.
