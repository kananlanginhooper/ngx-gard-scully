Symptoms of CAEBV may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, and an enlarged liver and/or spleen. More serious complications may include anemia, nerve damage, liver failure, and/or interstitial pneumonia. Symptoms may be constant or come and go, and tend to get worse over time. CAEBV occurs when the virus remains &lsquo;active&rsquo; and the symptoms of an EBV infection do not go away. It is diagnosed based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and blood tests that show EBV DNA remaining at high levels for at least 3 months. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms.&nbsp;The most well-documented, effective treatment for CAEBV is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.[8879][15026][15027]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome people with fatigue alone are mistakenly thought to have CAEBV.
