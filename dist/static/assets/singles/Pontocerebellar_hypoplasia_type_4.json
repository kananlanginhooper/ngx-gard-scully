The three PCH phenotypes (which differ mainly in life expectancy) were considered to be distinct entities before their molecular basis was known. PCH2. Children usually succumb before age ten years (those with PCH4 and 5 usually succumb as neonates). Children with PCH2 have generalized clonus, uncoordinated sucking and swallowing, impaired cognitive development, lack of voluntary motor development, cortical blindness, and an increased risk for rhabdomyolysis during severe infections. Epilepsy is present in approximately 50%. PCH4. Neonates often have seizures, multiple joint contractures (\\\"arthrogryposis\\\"), generalized clonus, and central respiratory impairment. PCH5 resembles PCH4 and has been described in one family.","Disease__c":"Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 4","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C1856974","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
