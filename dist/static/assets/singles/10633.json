Symptoms of an ependymoma are related to the location and size of the tumor and may include nausea, vomiting, headache, pain, numbness, bowel or bladder symptoms, and various other signs and symptoms. The cause of ependymomas is unknown.[3251] They are known to recur locally (more commonly in individuals diagnosed in childhood).[3252][3250] Treatment may vary depending on&nbsp;the location, <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/diagnosis-staging/prognosis/tumor-grade-fact-sheet\" target=\"_blank\">grade</a>, and whether the tumor has spread to the spine,[3251] but&nbsp;typically includes aggressive surgery.[3250] Management may also include <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=45214\" target=\"_blank\">chemotherapy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=44971\" target=\"_blank\">radiation therapy</a>.[3252]","dateModified":"2015-04-13T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":4317,"questionText":"How might myxopapillary ependymoma be treated?","answerText":"Standard treatment of myxopapillary ependymoma is surgery with the aim of removing as much of the tumor as possible.
