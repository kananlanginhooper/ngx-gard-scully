It is most common in young males living in dry, hot climates such as in Mediterranean areas, central and west Africa, the Middle East, Japan, the Indian subcontinent and South America. It is also seen in Western Europe (including the UK and Sweden), Australia and North America - although the prevalence in these countries has probably increased due to migration of more susceptible populations.[4733] One survey suggests VKC may have a prevalence rate of 3.2 per 10,000 individuals in Western Europe.[4734] Another study involving over 400 affected individuals only in an area of Northern Italy reported that the average&nbsp;incidence independent of gender and age was 1 in 100,000 new cases.
