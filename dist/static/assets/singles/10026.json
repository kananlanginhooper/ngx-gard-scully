The condition is primarily associated with <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000686.htm\" target=\"_blank\">sciatica</a>; however, other symptoms may include tenderness, aching, tingling and/or numbness of the buttock and pain when sitting for a long period of time, climbing stairs, walking or running. Piriformis syndrome is caused by damage, irritation or overuse of the piriformis muscle which can make&nbsp;the muscle swell or tighten. This puts pressure on the nerve beneath it (the sciatic nerve) which leads to the signs and symptoms of the condition. In many cases, medical treatment may not be needed and home remedies (such as avoiding activities that trigger pain, over-the-counter pain medications, ice packs, heating pads, and stretching exercises) can help alleviate symptoms. In more severe cases, muscle relaxants, electrotherapy, or even surgery may be recommended.[13234][13235][13236]","dateModified":"2017-03-21T15:14:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
