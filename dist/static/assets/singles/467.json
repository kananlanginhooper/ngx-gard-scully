This usually occurs within the first few days after birth.&nbsp;Without early diagnosis and treatment, these symptoms may lead&nbsp; to more serious medical problems, including heart abnormalities, seizures, intellectual disability, coma, and possibly death.

Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, blood and urine testing, and may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing.
