As the embryo grows and divides, an attempt may be made to correct the mistake by eliminating one extra chromosome 8. In individuals with mosaic trisomy 8, this attempt may be partly successful, leaving some cells with an extra chromosome 8 and some cells with the extra chromosome deleted (the usual chromosome number). This correction process is called&nbsp;trisomy rescue.[11559]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn other cases, the egg and sperm may have a normal number of chromosomes, but an error of cell division (nondisjunction) occurs when the fertilized egg is growing and dividing. If an error occurs during one of the divisions, it can cause some cells to have an abnormal number of chromosomes. In people affected by mosaic trisomy 8, some of the body's cells have the usual two copies of chromosome 8, and other cells have three copies of this chromosome (trisomy). The percentage of cells with trisomy 8 and which parts of the body are affected vary from person to person.
