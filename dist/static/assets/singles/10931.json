Symptoms such as intermittent double vision (diplopia) or bulging eyes (proptosis), pain and/or orbital bleeding (hemorrhage)&nbsp;may&nbsp;be brought on by stooping, bending, coughing or straining. Small lesions are managed through observation. Larger lesions may require surgery.[5330][5331][5332]","dateModified":"2012-07-17T16:24:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6667,"questionText":"How might&nbsp;orbital varix be treated?","answerText":"Most people with orbital varices experience little too few symptoms and require no treatment.[5748] Occasionally progressive eye pain, eye bulging, compression of the <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/9708.htm\" target=_blank>optic nerve</a>, vision loss and/or disfigurement develops and prompts&nbsp;treatment.[5748][5749][5750]&nbsp;<br><br>There are no well established guidelines for&nbsp;treatment.&nbsp;Treatment is&nbsp;individually tailored to the&nbsp;patient.&nbsp;People seeking treatment for&nbsp;obital varices benefit from a consultation with a&nbsp;team of doctors,&nbsp;such as an opthalmologist, neurosurgeon, and/or&nbsp;neurointerventional radiologist.[5748][5749]&nbsp;Treatment with&nbsp;electrothrombosis (the use of&nbsp;an electrical current to block blood flow to the varix),[5749] stereotactic <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/gamma-knife-radiosurgery/MY00206/METHOD=print\" target=_blank>gamma knife radiosurgery</a>[5748], <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sclerotherapy/my01302\" target=_blank>sclerotherapy</a>, surgical resection, and embolization&nbsp;(blocking of blood flow through the varix)&nbsp;with <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002894.htm\" target=_blank>cyanoacrylate</a> glue followed by excision have been described in the medical literature.[5749]","dateModified":"2013-01-11T10:28:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":5748,"authors":"Xu D, Liu D, Zhang Z, Zhang Y, Song G","articleTitle":"Gamma knife radiosurgery for primary orbital varices: a preliminary report","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Br J Ophthalmol","date":"2011 Sep;95(9):1264-7","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20971792","dateAccessed":"2013-01-10T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":5749,"authors":"Couch SM, Garrity JA, Cameron JD, Cloft HJ","articleTitle":"Embolization of orbital varices with N-butyl cyanoacrylate as an aid in surgical excision: results of 4 cases with histopathologic examination","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Am J Ophthalmol","date":"2009 Oct;148(4):614-618.e1","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19541289","dateAccessed":"2013-01-10T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":5750,"authors":"Tsai AS, Fong KS, Lim W, Al Jajeh I, Chuah CT, Rootman J","articleTitle":"Bilateral orbital varices: an approach to management","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Ophthal Plast Reconstr Surg","date":"2008 Nov-Dec;24(6):486-8","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19033851","dateAccessed":"2013-01-10T00:00:00"}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[{"caseId":37701,"abbreviatedInquiry":"I have an orbital varix in my left&nbsp;eye.
