They may occur in any age (4&ndash;75 years), but are more common in young patients.[14016] Symptoms may include seizures, headaches, bleedings, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003191.htm\" target=\"_blank\">focal neurological deficits</a>, impairing specific and small parts of the body.[14016][14015] According to the 2016 <a href=\"https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1\">WHO classification of CNS tumors</a>&nbsp; the papillary GNTs are considered WHO grade I tumors.[14014] The grading of a tumor refers about how the tumor tissue look under a microscope, and indicates how quickly a tumor is likely to grow and spread. In grade 1 tumors, the tumor cells and the organization of the tumor tissue appear close to normal and they tend to grow and spread slowly.[14017] Papillary GNTs are usually located in the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0022789/?figure=1\">cerebral hemispheres</a> (the two halves of the brain) next to the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://img.medscapestatic.com/pi/meds/ckb/24/12424tn.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1923254-overview&amp;h=357&amp;w=380&amp;tbnid=kRoSb4aELkoquM:&amp;tbnh=160&amp;tbnw=170&amp;usg=__u3B9_0J1HBs-OIFcOsZ98czzUmE=&amp;vet=10ahUKEwivj7yLtJvXAhWrxFQKHTJSCF4Q9QEIKjAA..i&amp;docid=1g1dhD-UTpX7iM&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivj7yLtJvXAhWrxFQKHTJSCF4Q9QEIKjAA\">cerebral ventricles</a>, the fluid-filled cavities of the brain. They are mixed tumors that contain both <a href=\"https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/cells.html\">neural cells</a> (neurons),&nbsp; which transmit the impulses in the brain, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10869/\">glial</a>&nbsp;cells (astrocytes) that help support the neurons. Treatment is done with surgery to remove the tumor and usually results in a good prognosis with long-term survival.[14016]<br />","dateModified":"2017-10-31T13:57:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
