Seizures can be followed by drop attacks, which can lead to falls and injuries. <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000696.htm\">Absence seizures</a> may occur. People with the condition may experience several seizures each day. The epilepsy may result in a delay or regression of skills.<span>&nbsp; </span> Autistic features and ataxic (poorly controlled) movements have been reported in some cases. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment may include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682412.html\">valproic acid</a> alone or with other antiepileptic drugs. Ketogenic (high fat, low carb) diet has been successful in some. Long term outlook ranges from persistent seizures that do not respond to treatment and intellectual disability, to complete seizure remission after several years and normal outcome.
