It most often occurs as a complication of surgery involving the parotid gland (a major salivary gland located below the ear). It may also occur following <span><a href=\"https://www.ahns.info/neck-dissection/\">neck dissection</a></span>, facelift procedures, or trauma to the area near the parotid gland.[15358][15359] Symptoms usually develop within several months of the procedure or trauma, but may develop several years later.[15358][15359] The main symptoms include flushing and excessive sweating (<a href=\"https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/dry-sweaty-skin/hyperhidrosis\" target=\"_blank\"><span>hyperhidrosis</span></a><a></a>) on the cheek, temple, or behind the ear, when eating or thinking about food (<span><a href=\"https://www.sweathelp.org/where-do-you-sweat/other-sweating/gustatory-sweating.html\">gustatory sweating</a></span>).[15358][15359] Some people with Frey&rsquo;s syndrome may experience a burning sensation, itching, or pain around the affected area.[15358] The symptoms are usually mild but can be severe, causing significant discomfort or social anxiety.[15358][15359]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrey&rsquo;s syndrome is thought to be caused by damage to both the nerves that regulate the sweat glands, and the nerves that regulate the parotid glands.[15359] It is believed that the damaged nerves regrow abnormally and connect to the wrong glands.[15359] Frey&rsquo;s syndrome is diagnosed based on medical history (e.g. a history of surgery or trauma) and symptoms. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a test called the <span><a href=\"https://www.sweathelp.org/education-and-resources/starch-iodine-onabotulinumtoxina-injection-protocol-for-axillary-treatment.html\">Minor's starch-iodine test</a></span>.[15358]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment, when needed, is focused on controlling the symptoms and often involves injections of <span><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/botox.html\">botulinum toxin A</a></span> (Botox) and/or topical antiperspirants.[15358] Repeat Botox injections are often needed as symptoms return, which occurs yearly on average.[15358][15359] Of note, although Botox injections have been reported to improve symptoms and quality of life, no randomized controlled trials of its use to treat Frey&rsquo;s syndrome have been documented.[15359] <br />\r\n<div id=\"_com_1\" language=\"JavaScript\"> </div>","dateModified":"2019-04-10T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
