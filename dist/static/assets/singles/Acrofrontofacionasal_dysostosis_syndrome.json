The cranio-facial malformations are numerous and variable and include brachycephaly or microbrachycephaly. Other skeletal malformations are also present, with syndactyly of fingers, hypoplastic toes, anomalies of feet structure and fibular hypoplasia. Short stature may be observed. Eye anomalies include bilateral ptosis, cataract and congenital glaucoma. In some male patients, hypospadias and bifid scrotum are reported. Patients suffer from potentially severe intellectual deficit and present with anomalies of the cortical gyration.","Disease__c":"Acrofrontofacionasal dysostosis syndrome","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C1860118","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
