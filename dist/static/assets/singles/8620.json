Glomus vagale tumors, specifically, grow in the paraganglia located near the vagus nerve, an important cranial nerve which serves many functions including empowering the vocal cords and the muscles of swallowing. In most cases, the tumors are <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?CdrID=45614\" target=\"_blank\">benign</a>, although rare cancerous cases have been reported. Signs and symptoms vary based on the size and location of the tumor but may include a neck mass, tinnitus (ringing or buzzing in the ears), difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, pain, cough, and/or cranial nerve paralysis. Some tumors may not be associated with any concerning features and are diagnosed by chance during <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/diagnosticimaging.html\" target=\"_blank\">imaging studies</a> performed to investigate other conditions.[11338][11342] In many cases, the underlying cause of glomus vagale tumors is poorly understood. Approximately 40-50% of affected people report a family history of the condition.[11344][11338] Glomus vagale tumors can be associated with inherited syndromes caused by genetic changes (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>) in succinate dehydrogenase subunits (i.e. <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SDHB\" target=\"_blank\">SDHB</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SDHD\" target=\"_blank\">SDHD</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SDHA\" target=\"_blank\">SDHA</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SDHAF2\" target=\"_blank\">SDHAF2</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SDHC\" target=\"_blank\">SDHC</a></em>) or the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MAX\" target=\"_blank\">MAX</a></em> gene.[11343][11338] Treatment usually includes surgery.[11338][11342]","dateModified":"2016-04-25T16:20:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
