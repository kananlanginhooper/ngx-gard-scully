There are mild, typical, and severe forms of FCMD. Symptoms begin at birth and include a poor suck, weak cry, and floppiness. Later symptoms include severe speech delay, intellectual disability, seizures, and visual impairment. Over time, muscle damage can lead to heart, breathing, and swallowing problems. Many people with Fukuyama type muscular dystrophy die in early adulthood due to respiratory or heart failure. Fukuyama type muscular dystrophy is caused by genetic variants in the <em><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/fktn\" target=\"_blank\">FKTN</a></em> gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, imaging studies of the brain, and confirmed by the results of genetic testing. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms.[15850][15851][15852]","dateModified":"2020-10-13T12:01:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13701,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Fukuyama type muscular dystrophy?&nbsp;","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with Fukuyama type muscular dystrophy.
