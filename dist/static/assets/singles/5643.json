It can lead to involuntary movements, mental and emotional problems, and a decline in thinking ability. Symptoms usually appear around 30 years of age, but can occur anytime from infancy to mid-adulthood. Specific signs and symptoms may differ  and include seizures, issues with balance and coordination (ataxia), and involuntary muscle jerking or twitching (myoclonus).

In people with DRPLA, the CAG segment is repeated at least 48 times (and sometimes much more). When the CAG trinucleotide repeat is abnormally long, it changes the structure of the atrophin 1 protein.
