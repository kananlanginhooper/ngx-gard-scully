In CAPS multiple blood clots form throughout the body over a short period of time (usually within a week). CAPS is a medical emergency, as clots can cause life-threatening multi-organ failure. The cause of CAPS is unknown. A widely accepted explanation  is that it is caused by a\r\ncombination of gene mutations (making one more susceptible to CAPS) and\r\nan environmental trigger, such as an infection, trauma, or surgery.[11567]","dateModified":"2016-05-25T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":5824,"relatedDiseaseName":"Antiphospholipid syndrome","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12198,"relatedDiseaseName":"Antiphospholipid syndrome with lupus antibodies ","relation":"Child","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":false}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
