The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with chromosome 6q duplication include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. In most cases, chromosome 6q duplication occurs <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/de-novo-mutation/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>de novo</em></a> or is inherited from a parent with a <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=rearrangement\" target=\"_blank\">chromosomal rearrangement</a> such as a <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/structuralchanges\" target=\"_blank\">balanced translocation</a>.
