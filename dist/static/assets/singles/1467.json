Mutations in these genes lead to deficient levels of enzymes which cause low levels of hormones such as cortisol and/or aldosterone and an overproduction of androgens (male hormones such as testosterone). Cortisol is a hormone that affects energy levels, blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and the body's response to stress, illness, and injury. Aldosterone helps the body maintain the proper level of sodium (salt) and water and helps maintain blood pressure.

Nonclassic CAH is not detected through newborn screening and is often not suspected until signs and symptoms of the condition begin to appear later in childhood or early adulthood. In these cases, a diagnosis of CAH is usually based on physical examination; blood and urine tests that measure hormone levels; and/or genetic testing. An X-ray may also be helpful in confirming the diagnosis in children since CAH can cause bones to grow and develop more quickly than usual (advanced bone age) .[8036][8037][8038]","dateModified":"2014-12-27T09:40:00","resourceClassificationName":"Diagnosis","references":[{"referenceId":8036,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Organization of Rare Disorders (NORD)","date":"Updated 2018","volume":"","pages":"","url":". https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8037,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development","date":"July 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/cah/Pages/default.aspx","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8038,"authors":"Thomas A Wilson, MD","articleTitle":"Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"April 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/919218-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":8076,"questionText":"How might congenital adrenal hyperplasia be treated?","answerText":"The best treatment options for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) depend on many factors including the type of CAH and the signs and symptoms present in each person.
