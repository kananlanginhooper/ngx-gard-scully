Muscles in the legs (thighs and calves) are most commonly affected, although other muscles (such as muscles in the arm or chest) can also be involved. Other signs and symptoms may include burning or prickling sensations (paresthesias), muscle stiffness, over-responsive reflexes (hyperreflexia), anxiety, and fatigue.[14806][9292] Symptoms are often triggered by physical activity and may be relieved by stretching exercises and/or massage. The severity of the condition varies significantly from person to person. In severe cases, CFS can interfere with daily activities and quality of life.[9292]","dateModified":"2018-07-18T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":9292,"authors":"Tahmoush AJ, Alonso RJ, Tahmoush GP, Heiman-Patterson TD","articleTitle":"Cramp-fasciculation syndrome: a treatable hyperexcitable peripheral nerve disorder","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Neurology","date":"July 1991","volume":"41(7)","pages":"1021-1024","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1648679","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14806,"authors":"Nirenberg MJ, Chaouni R, Biller TM, Gilbert RM, Paisán-Ruiz C","articleTitle":"A novel TRPA1 variant is associated with carbamazepine-responsive cramp-fasciculation syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Clin Genet","date":"January, 2018","volume":"93(1)","pages":"164-168","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28436534","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":9107,"questionText":"What causes cramp-fasciculation syndrome?","answerText":"Cramp-fasciculation syndrome (CFS) may have multiple underlying causes.[9293] In general, it is thought to be related to abnormal excitability (overactivity) of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/peripheralnervedisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">peripheral neurons</a>.[9293] However, in many people with CFS, the cause cannot be found (idiopathic CFS).[9293]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe following have been reported to be associated with CFS:[9293][9300]\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Genetic or <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000816.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autoimmune</a> dysfunction of ion channels</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000593.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Peripheral neuropathy</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/motor_neuron_diseases/detail_motor_neuron_diseases.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Anterior-horn-cell disease</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/metabolicdisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">Metabolic</a>&nbsp;abnormalities</li>\r\n    <li>Tumors (most commonly <a href=\"https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/thymoma/introduction\" target=\"_blank\">thymoma</a>)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSome familial cases of CFS have been reported.[14129]&nbsp;To our knowledge, no genes have been found responsible for familial cases of isolated CFS (occurring without an associated disorder).
