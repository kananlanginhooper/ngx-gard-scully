Signs and symptoms vary, but facial features may been reported to include thick eyebrows, wide-spaced eyes, and narrow eye openings. People with WSS may also have hairy arms and back, feeding disorders, behavior problems, and seizures. Because WSS has been reported in a small number of individuals, information on how it changes over time is limited. WSS is caused by pathogenic variants in the <em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4297\" target=\"_blank\">KMT2A</a></em> gene, and is usually occurs in an individual with no other family history. In a few cases, it has been inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>&nbsp;pattern.
