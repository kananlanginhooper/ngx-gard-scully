Most people get EBV in childhood, but the virus becomes \"inactive\" because the immune system keeps it under control. In people with PTLD due to EBV, a weakened immune system may allow EBV to reactivate in infected B-cells, leading to their uncontrolled growth. In some cases, EBV from the transplant donor is reactivated in the recipient. PTLD can also occur if a recipient first becomes infected with EBV after  the transplant.[15257][15258] The reason that PTLD develops in people without EBV is not clear.[15256]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPTLD is diagnosed by <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/immunophenotyping\" target=\"_blank\">immunophenotyping</a> a biopsy of an involved lymph node or other affected tissue.[15257] Additional tests such as blood tests, imaging tests, or bone marrow biopsy may be needed to determine the location(s) and extent of the disease in the body.[15257]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment recommendations may vary among people with PTLD but typically include lowering the dose of immunosuppresive drugs to allow the immune system to fight the EBV-infected cells.[15257] There are no therapies approved by the FDA to treat PTLD, but additional treatment options include using <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/rituximab\" target=\"_blank\">rituximab</a>, surgery to remove affected tissue, radiation therapy, <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/immunotherapy\" target=\"_blank\">immunotherapy</a>, and&nbsp;chemotherapy.
