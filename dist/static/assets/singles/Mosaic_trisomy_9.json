Principle characteristics are intellectual disability, growth and developmental delay, facial dysmorphism (including microphthalmia, deep-set eyes, low-set, malformed ears, bulbous nose, high-arched palate, micrognathia) and congenital heart defects (ventricular septal defect), as well as urogenital (hypoplastic genitalia, cryptorchidism), skeletal (congenital joint dislocations or hyperflexion, scoliosis/kyphosis) and central nervous system anomalies (hydrocephalus, Dandy-Walker malformation).
