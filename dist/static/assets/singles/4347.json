In about 20 to 40 percent of cases, the condition occurs alone.[11516] The exact causes of Pierre Robin syndrome are unknown.[5364] Changes (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>)&nbsp;in the <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/25520880\" target=\"_blank\">DNA</a>  near the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SOX9\" target=\"_blank\">SOX9</a></em>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a>&nbsp;are the most common genetic cause of isolated cases of Pierre Robin sequence.[11516] Treatment is focused on the specific needs of each patient, but may include surgery to assist with breathing and feeding modifications to prevent choking.[5364]\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","dateModified":"2016-05-16T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6309,"questionText":"What causes Pierre Robin sequence?","answerText":"Pierre Robin sequence  is a condition with multiple causes.[11864] At about 7-10 weeks into a pregnancy, the lower jaw grows rapidly, allowing the tongue to descend from between the two halves of the palate. If, for some reason, the lower jaw does not grow properly, the tongue can prevent the palate from closing, resulting in a <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001051.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cleft palate</a>. The small or displaced lower jaw also causes the tongue to be positioned at the back of the mouth causing breathing difficulties when the child is born. This \"sequence of events\" is the reason why the condition has been classified as a sequence.[11862][5366][11863]. The exact causes of Pierre Robin sequence are unknown.[5364] Possible mechanisms for the sequence include genetic causes; low volume of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios), which may limit chin growth; weakness of the facial muscles (myotonia); or connective tissue disease.[11864]\r\n<p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">The genetic causes for some of the isolated cases (Pierre Robin sequence without any associated malformations) may include&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>&nbsp;or deletions of parts of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/25520880\" target=\"_blank\">DNA</a>  neighboring the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SOX9\" target=\"_blank\">SOX9</a>&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a>&nbsp;(located in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/17#ideogram\" target=\"_blank\">chromosome 17 (17q24)</a>).<span>&nbsp;This gene provides&nbsp;</span><span>instructions</span><span>&nbsp;for making a&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/howgeneswork/protein\" target=\"_blank\">protein</a>&nbsp;(protein SOX9) that plays an important role in the formation of many different tissues and organs during embryonic development.
