It is mainly found in females and is characterized by small or poorly developed eyes (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/microphthalmia\" target=\"_blank\">microphthalmia</a>) and characteristic linear skin markings on the head and neck.[13427][13428] The signs and symptoms of this condition may include abnormalities of the brain, heart, and genitourinary system. Other symptoms may include short stature, developmental delay, and finger and toenails that do not grow normally (nail dystrophy).[13427][13428] MLS syndrome is typically caused by either a deletion of certain genetic material on the p (short) arm of the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/X\" target=\"_blank\">X chromosome</a> or by a mutation in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HCCS\" target=\"_blank\">HCCS</a></em> gene. In some cases, it may be caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/COX7B\" target=\"_blank\">COX7B</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/NDUFB11\" target=\"_blank\">NDUFB11</a></em> genes, (also located on the X chromosome). According to the mutated gene, the disease may be classified in three subtypes.[13429][13430][13431] This condition is inherited in an X-linked manner and is thought to result in serious early developmental concerns in males, leading to almost no males with this condition surviving to delivery.[13427]&nbsp;Although there is no specific treatment or cure for MLS syndrome, there may be ways to manage the symptoms.

Most commonly, individuals are found to have small or poorly formed eyes (microphthalmia). One or both eyes may also be missing (anophthalmia).

Males that inherit MLS syndrome usually have very serious developmental concerns.
