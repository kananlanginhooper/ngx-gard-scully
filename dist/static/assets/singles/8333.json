The main symptoms include inability to move the eyes to the sides (horizontal gaze paralysis), deafness, and birth defects involving blood flow in and out of the heart. Human HOXA1 syndromes have been described in Native American populations (primarily the Navajo and Apache Indians) and in a few Saudi Arabian and Turkish families. Symptoms may vary by population.
