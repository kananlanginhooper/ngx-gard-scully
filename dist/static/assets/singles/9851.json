An attack may also cause seizures, muscle weakness, and/or paralysis of one side of the body (hemiplegia). Age of onset, symptoms and severity can vary. Some people have several attacks per day, while others may have one or two per year.[4471] Episodic ataxia may be caused by a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a>&nbsp;in any of several genes and is inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>&nbsp;manner.

In some cases, symptoms improve or go away on their own.[11307]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt least 8 types of episodic ataxia have been recognized (referred to as types 1 through 8), which are distinguished based on their age of onset, features, and/or genetic cause.[4471]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2016-04-21T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":4346,"relatedDiseaseName":"Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":9602,"relatedDiseaseName":"Episodic ataxia with nystagmus","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":6614,"relatedDiseaseName":"Hereditary ataxia","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":1512,"relatedDiseaseName":"Hereditary continuous muscle fiber activity","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[{"caseId":56311,"abbreviatedInquiry":"I would like to obtain information about episodic ataxia type 5.

The channels are important for a cell's ability to make and transmit electrical signals.&nbsp;In the brain, calcium channels play an essential role in communication between nerve cells (neurons). They help control the release of neurotransmitters, which pass signals between neurons. Researchers believe these channels are also involved in the survival of neurons and their ability to adapt over time. Mutations in the <em>CACNB4</em> gene are thought to impair the function of calcium channels in the brain, but exactly how this results in the features of EA5 is poorly understood.[11310]&nbsp;Mutations in <em>CACNB4</em> are also found in some people with generalized epilepsy and <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/6808/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/Resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">juvenile myoclonic epilepsy</a>.[11308]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEA5 is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>&nbsp;manner.&nbsp;This means that having a mutation in only one copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition.&nbsp;In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutated gene from an affected parent. In other cases, the mutation occurs for the first time in a person with no family history of the condition. When a person with a mutation that causes an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit that mutation. However, it has been suggested that not all people with a&nbsp;<em>CACNB4</em>&nbsp;mutation will develop EA5. This phenomenon is called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/inheritance/penetranceexpressivity\" target=\"_blank\">reduced penetrance</a>. It has been estimated that roughly 70% of people with a mutation will develop EA5.[11309]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlike in some of the other types of episodic ataxia, the symptoms of EA5 are considered responsive to medical treatment with <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682756.html\" target=\"_blank\">acetazolamide</a>.[11308][11309] The frequency of attacks decreases markedly on acetazolamide (i.e., it can prevent attacks), and increases if the medication is discontinued.[11309]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2016-04-25T00:00:00","references":[{"referenceId":11307,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Frequently Asked Questions About...
