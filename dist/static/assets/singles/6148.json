The type of blood clots seen in individuals with this condition are typically clots that form in the deep veins of the leg (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/deepveinthrombosis.html\" target=\"_blank\">deep vein thrombosis </a>or DVT) and clots that lodge in the lungs (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/pulmonaryembolism.html\" target=\"_blank\">pulmonary embolism </a>or PE). Approximately 50% of individuals with hereditary antithrombin deficiency will develop one or more clots in their lifetime, usually after adolescence. Factors that may increase the likelihood of clotting&nbsp;include pregnancy, the use of oral contraceptives, surgery, increasing age, and a lack of movement. Hereditary antithrombin deficiency is caused by mutations in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SERPINC1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>SERPINC1</em> gene </a>and is typically inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant </a>manner.[9445][9446]","dateModified":"2015-08-05T12:01:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":9222,"questionText":"How might hereditary antithrombin deficiency be treated?","answerText":"Once a patient with hereditary antithrombin deficiency develops a clot, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/bloodthinners.html\" target=\"_blank\">anticoagulation</a> therapy (usually<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682277.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Warfarin</a>) is often indicated. The duration of therapy after a first clot, especially in children,&nbsp;is a matter of some controversy, but therapy is generally continued for 3-6 months. Individuals who experience a second clot are at a significant risk for future clotting and are candidates for long-term Warfarin therapy. Asymptomatic individuals are often not treated with anticoagulation therapy. Should surgery be necessary, individuals with hereditary antithrombin deficiency may receive antithrombin III concentrate or fresh frozen plasma to boost antithrombin levels.[9447]","dateModified":"2015-08-05T12:32:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":9447,"authors":"Harper, James","articleTitle":"Antithrombin III Deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"July 10, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/954688-overview","dateAccessed":"2015-08-05T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":9223,"questionText":"What is the prognosis for individuals with hereditary antithrombin deficiency?","answerText":"The prognosis depends on the degree of antithrombin deficiency, the nature of the clots formed, and the number of clots formed.

Thank you!","caseQuestions":[{"questionId":9349,"questionText":"What pregnancy risks are associated with hereditary antithrombin deficiency, MTHFR gene mutation, and solitary kidney?","answerText":"Most women with antithrombin deficiency have successful pregnancy outcomes, however studies have shown that they are at an increased&nbsp;(31-49%) risk for blood clots during and following pregnancy.[9578] They are also slightly more likely to suffer pregnancy loss without treatment than women without the deficiency (risk for pregnancy loss is around 19%, in comparison women without the deficiency have a 12% risk).[9446][9578] Having a single MTHFR gene mutation is not associated with significant increased pregnancy risks,[9576] however having two MTHFR gene mutations, or having combined genetic risk factors (e.g., MTHFR and antithrombin deficiency) may add to overall risk. Unfortunately it is very difficult to calculate these specific risks. For women with inherited thrombophilias (like antithrombin deficiency), many recommend the use of low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin during pregnancy and for at least six weeks following delivery to manage clot risks.[9441][9576]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe advocacy and support group, Clot Connect summarizes the treatment guidelines for pregnant women with thrombophilia at the following link:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://patientblog.clotconnect.org/2011/08/24/pregnancy-and-blood-clots-prevention-diagnosis-treatment/\">Pregnancy and Blood Clots: Prevention, Diagnosis, Treatment</a> (Clot Connect)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSolitary kidney may occur as a result of kidney donation, medical treatment, or due to a congenital birth defect. Having solitary kidney as a result of kidney donation is associated with an increased risk for high blood pressure (preeclampsia) during pregnancy, but maternal and fetal outcomes are comparable to women with two kidneys.[9574] It is not clear if and if so how preeclampsia risk might complicate thrombophilia related risks. Risks for pregnancy complications in women with a history of medical treatment resulting in solitary kidney or congenital absence of one kidney will vary from case to case. Women who are born with a single kidney should be evaluated for anatomical differences of their internal reproductive tract. Around 30% of women born with a single kidney have abnormalities of the reproductive tract, the presence of which may affect fertility and pregnancy outcomes.[9573][9574]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther information on solitary kidney is available at the following Web site:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kidneyurology.org/Library/Kidney_Health/Solitary_Kidney.php\">Solitary Kidney</a> (Kidney &amp; Urology Foundation of America, Inc)","dateModified":"2015-09-01T12:11:00","references":[{"referenceId":5019,"authors":"Lipe B, Ornstein L","articleTitle":"Deficiencies of Natural Anticoagulants, Protein C, Protein S, and Antithrombin","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Circulation","date":"2011","url":"http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/124/14/e365.full","dateAccessed":"2011-03-06T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":9446,"authors":"Bauer, Kenneth","articleTitle":"Antithrombin Deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)","date":"2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/antithrombin-deficiency/","dateAccessed":"2015-08-05T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9573,"authors":"Heinonen PK","articleTitle":"Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia associated with unilateral renal agenesis in women with uterine malformations","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol","date":"2004 May 10","volume":"114(1)","pages":"39-43","url":"","dateAccessed":"2015-09-01T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9574,"authors":"Neelu M et al.,","articleTitle":"Pregnancy induced hypertension with unilateral renal agenesis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Obstet Gynecol India","date":"January/February 2005","volume":"55(1)","pages":"77-78","url":"http://medind.nic.in/jaq/t05/i1/jaqt05i1p77.pdf","dateAccessed":"2015-09-01T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9575,"authors":"Ilonczai P et al.,","articleTitle":"Management and outcome of pregnancies in women with antithrombin deficiency: a single-center experience and review of literature","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis","date":"2015 Jul 29","volume":"","pages":"","url":"","dateAccessed":"2015-09-01T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9576,"authors":"Lockwood CJ","articleTitle":"Inherited thrombophilias in pregnant patients: detection and treatment paradigm","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Obstet Gynecol","date":"2002 Feb","volume":"99(2)","pages":"333-41","url":"","dateAccessed":"2015-09-01T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9577,"authors":"Khalafallah AA et al.,","articleTitle":"Review of Management and Outcomes in Women with Thrombophilia Risk during Pregnancy at a Single Institution","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"ISRN Obstet Gynecol","date":"2014 Feb 17","volume":"2014","pages":"381826","url":"","dateAccessed":"2015-09-01T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9578,"authors":"Patnaik M, Moll S","articleTitle":"Inherited antithrombin deficiency: a review","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Haemophilia","date":"2008","volume":"14","pages":"1229–12","url":"","dateAccessed":"2015-09-01T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":9350,"questionText":"Who should I talk to regarding my pregnancy risks?","answerText":"We strongly recommend that you talk to your doctor regarding a referral\r\nto a Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) specialist.
