Because people with Tangier disease have very low levels of HDL, they have a moderately increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Additional signs and symptoms of Tangier disease include a slightly elevated amount of fat in the blood; disturbances in nerve function; and enlarged, orange-colored tonsils.

This gene provides instructions for making a protein that releases cholesterol and phospholipids from cells. These substances are used to make HDL, which transports them to the liver. Mutations in the <span class=geneSymbol>ABCA1</span> gene prevent the release of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells. As a result, these substances accumulate within cells, causing certain body tissues to enlarge and the tonsils to acquire a yellowish-orange color. A buildup of cholesterol can be toxic to cells, leading to impaired cell function or cell death. In addition, the inability to transport cholesterol and phospholipids out of cells results in very low HDL levels, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.
