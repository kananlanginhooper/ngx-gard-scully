Signs and symptoms of the condition are generally noticeable at birth and vary significantly from person to person, even within the same family.

Other common features include intellectual disability, growth delay, respiratory problems, camptodactyly (permanently bent fingers and toes) and cutaneous syndactyly (fusion of the skin between the fingers and toes).
