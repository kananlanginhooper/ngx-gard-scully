Children with type 1 usually do not survive past early childhood due to infection and cardiopulmonary failure. Type 2, which includes the late-infantile and juvenile forms, is an intermediate form of the condition. People with type 2 who have late-infantile onset usually survive into mid-childhood, while those with juvenile onset may live into early adulthood. Type 3, known as the adult or chronic form of GM1, is the mildest form of the condition. The age of onset and life expectancy for people with type 3 varies, but life expectancy is usually shortened.[4711][933]","dateModified":"2015-11-17T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Prognosis","references":[{"referenceId":933,"authors":"Tegay D","articleTitle":"GM1 Gangliosidosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape","date":"March 29, 2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/951637-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":4711,"authors":"","articleTitle":"GM1 gangliosidosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"August 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/gm1-gangliosidosis","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}]},{"caseId":36050,"abbreviatedInquiry":"Is physical therapy of any benefit to a 6-month-old with GM1?","caseQuestions":[{"questionId":1594,"questionText":"How might GM1 gangliosidosis be treated?<br />","answerText":"There is currently no&nbsp;effective medical treatment for&nbsp;GM1 gangliosidosis.[932][933] Symptomatic treatment for some of the neurologic signs and symptoms is available, but does not significantly alter the progression of the condition.[933][935]&nbsp;For example, anticonvulsants may initially control seizures.
