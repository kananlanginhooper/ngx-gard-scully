The authors of this study reported that severe disability (unable to walk) or relapses related to tapering of medication were present in five of the patients (13%).[11844]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt has been suggested that those with relapsing  disease have a better prognosis than those with the chronic progressive course. About 70% are said to make relatively good recovery from their relapses. However, some patients don't respond to the usual treatments and accumulate significant disability. Some patients have only a short treatment effect and become treatment dependent.[11843] According to <a href=\"http://www.gbs-cidp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">GBS/CIDP Foundation International</a>, early recognition and proper treatment can avoid a significant amount of disability. Left untreated, 30% of CIDP patients will progress to wheelchair dependence.[11848]","dateModified":"2016-07-12T12:00:00","references":[{"referenceId":11843,"authors":"Richard A Lewis","articleTitle":"Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"May 6, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1172965-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11844,"authors":"Richard A Lewis","articleTitle":"Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: Treatment and prognosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"June, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"Waltham, MA","publisher":"UpToDate"},{"referenceId":11848,"authors":"","articleTitle":"All About CIDP","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GBS/CIDP Foundation International","date":"2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.gbs-cidp.org/cidp/all-about-cidp/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}]},{"caseId":54089,"abbreviatedInquiry":"My father was diagnosed with CIDP last year at age 75.
