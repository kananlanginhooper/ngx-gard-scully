About 80% of carriers do not have signs or symptoms of X-ALD because they have another working copy of <em>ABCD1</em>.

However, about 5% of cases of X-ALD are caused by a new genetic change (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\">de novo</a>) in the individual. In these situations, the mother is not a carrier of the disease, and other family members are not at risk to have children with X-ALD. Therefore, when a male is diagnosed with X-ALD, it is important to determine if his mother is a carrier by testing her VLCFA levels or by genetic testing.[1308] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf a woman is found to be a carrier of X-ALD, for each of her children there is a 50% chance that he or she will inherit the change in <em>ABCD1. </em>This means that for each son, there is a 50% chance that he will be affected with X-ALD.
