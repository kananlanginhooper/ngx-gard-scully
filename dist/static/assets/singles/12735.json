The lack of these hormones in the body can be caused by reduction or cessation of corticosteroid medication, the surgical removal of pituitary tumors, or changes in the pituitary gland.[9532] Symptoms of secondary adrenal insufficiency may include severe fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle weakness, irritability, and depression.[9533] Treatment includes replacing the hormones that the adrenal glands are not making. The dose of each medication is adjusted to meet the needs of each affected individual.[9532]","dateModified":"2015-08-25T12:28:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
