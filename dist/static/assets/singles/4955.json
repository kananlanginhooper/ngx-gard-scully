SCA7 differs from most other forms of SCA in that visual problems, rather than poor coordination, are generally the earliest signs of the disease. Affected individuals have progressive changes in vision (which can result in blindness); symptoms of <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ataxia/DS00910\" target=_blank>ataxia</a>; slow eye movements; and mild changes in sensation or reflexes. Later symptoms include loss of motor control, unclear speech (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007470.htm\" target=_blank>dysarthria</a>), and difficulty swallowing (<a href=\"http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/dysph.asp\" target=_blank>dysphagia</a>).[3811] Onset in early childhood or infancy has an especially rapid and aggressive course often associated with <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000991.htm\" target=_blank>failure to thrive</a> and regression of motor milestones.[3812] SCA7 is caused by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=_blank>mutations</a> in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ATXN7\" target=_blank><em>ATXN7</em></a> gene and is inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=_blank>autosomal dominant</a> manner.[3812] Treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive.","dateModified":"2011-07-12T12:33:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":4867,"questionText":"How might spinocerebellar ataxia 7 be treated?","answerText":"Unfortunately, there is no cure for spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7).
