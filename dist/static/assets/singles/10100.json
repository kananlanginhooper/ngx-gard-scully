Specifically, people with Tietze syndrome have swelling of the cartilage that joins the upper ribs to the breastbone. This is called the costochondral junction. Signs and symptoms of this condition usually develop in people who are under the age of 40. Symptoms include mild to severe chest pain that may extend into the arms and shoulders. The chest, shoulders, and arms may also have redness and warmth.[6210] In some cases, Tietze syndrome may resolve on its own without treatment, while other people experience patterns of pain followed by some relief of pain. Management for pain includes options such as minimizing physical activity, applying heat or ice as directed by your doctor, and taking pain medications and/or <a href=\"http://www.rheumatology.org/I-Am-A/Patient-Caregiver/Treatments/NSAIDs\" target=\"_blank\">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</a>.

While the pain associated with Tietze syndrome usually subsides after several weeks or months, the swelling may persist.
