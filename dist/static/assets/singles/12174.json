In the spine, the vertebrae are misshapen and fused. Many people with this condition have an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001241.htm\" target=\"_blank\">scoliosis</a>). The ribs may be fused together or missing. These bone malformations lead to short, rigid necks and short midsections. Infants with spondylocostal dysostosis have small, narrow chests that cannot fully expand. This can lead to life-threatening breathing problems. Males with this condition are at an increased risk for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/inguinal-hernia/Pages/facts.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">inguinal hernia</a>, where the diaphragm is pushed down, causing the abdomen to bulge out. There are several types of spondylocostal dysostosis. These types have similar features and are distinguished by their genetic cause and how they are inherited, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> or <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> .[9856][9857] Some of the autosomal recessive types of spondylocostal dysostosis are called \"Jarcho-Levin syndrome\", a term that is more often used as a synonym for a similar condition known as \"<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/6798/spondylothoracic-dysostosis/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">spondylothoracic dysostosis</a>\".[9858]&nbsp;Treatment is symptomatic and supportive and may include respiratory support and surgery to correct inguinal hernia and scoliosis.[9858]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2016-04-22T15:23:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":10726,"relatedDiseaseName":"Spondylocostal dysostosis 1","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":9703,"relatedDiseaseName":"Spondylocostal dysostosis 2","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":4973,"relatedDiseaseName":"Spondylocostal dysostosis 3","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":4976,"relatedDiseaseName":"Spondylocostal dysostosis 4","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":12806,"relatedDiseaseName":"Spondylocostal dysostosis 5","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":12807,"relatedDiseaseName":"Spondylocostal dysostosis 6","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
