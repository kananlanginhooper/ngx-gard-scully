AAT is made in the liver cells and sent through the bloodstream to the lungs where it helps protect the lungs from damage. Having low levels of AAT (or no AAT) may allow the lungs to become damaged. A build-up of abnormal AAT can cause liver damage.[14198][1654][1328] Diagnosis may be suspected by finding low levels of AAT in the blood and confirmed by genetic testing.[14198][1654] Treatment may include infusions of AAT.

This gene gives the body instructions to make a protein  called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). One of the jobs of AAT is to protect the body from another protein called neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase is an enzyme that helps the body fight infections, but it can also attack healthy tissues (especially the lungs), if not controlled by AAT.[1654][1328]<br />\n<br />\nGenetic changes that cause AAT may mean that the body's liver cells make too little or no AAT, or make a form (variant) of AAT that does not work well (abnormal AAT). This allows neutrophil elastase to destroy lung tissue, causing lung disease.[14198][1328]&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nIn addition, abnormal AAT can build up in the liver and cause damage to the liver, especially in people who have two copies of the specific genetic variant called allele Z (sometimes written as PI*ZZ).
