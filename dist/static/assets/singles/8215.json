The potential role of these factors has created increased difficulty in determining the real cause of isolated MD.[4986]<br><br><a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=_blank>Mutations</a>&nbsp;in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SLC26A4\" target=_blank><em>SLC26A4</em></a> gene cause both <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/4271/Pendred_syndrome.aspx\" target=_blank>Pendred syndrome</a> and DFNB4 (non-syndromic hearing loss with inner ear abnormalities), which are both associated with MD.[4986][4987] Though mutations in the SLC26A4 gene have also been found in individuals with <a href=\"http://www.vestibular.org/vestibular-disorders/specific-disorders/enlarged-vest.-aqueduct.php\" target=_blank>enlarged vestibular aqueduct</a> (EVA) with and without MD, studies have shown there does not appear to be a relationship between isolated MD and the SLC26A4 gene. Thus hearing impairment in individuals&nbsp;with isolated MD may be caused by factors other than mutations in the SLC26A4 gene.[4986] More recently, a type of mutation called a microdeletion (a tiny loss of genetic material on a chromosome that may span several genes) involving the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/POU3F4\" target=_blank><em>POU3F4</em></a> gene&nbsp;on the X chromosome was detected in some individuals with familial MD.[4989]<br><br>In cases where Mondini dysplasia is associated with a&nbsp;specific syndrome, the cause of the syndrome in the affected individual is assumed to be related to the occurrence of MD in those cases.
