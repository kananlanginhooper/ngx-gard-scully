Babies and children are larger than normal usually until age 8, when growth slows down, resulting in an average height in adults.&nbsp; Symptoms may include one side or area of the body growing more than the other side (asymmetric growth or <a href=\"http://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/hemihyperplasia\" target=\"_blank\">hemihyperplasia</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000994.htm\" target=\"_blank\">omphalocele</a> or other abdominal wall defect at birth, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), abnormally large abdominal organs, creases or pits in the skin near the ears, and kidney abnormalities. Affected children have an increased risk to develop tumors, particularly&nbsp; a rare form of kidney cancer called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wilms-tumor/basics/definition/con-20043492\" target=\"_blank\">Wilms tumor</a>, a cancer of muscle tissue called rhabdomyosarcoma, and a form of liver cancer called  <a href=\"http://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/hepatoblastoma-liver-cancer#.VdtcOPNViko\" target=\"_blank\">hepatoblastoma</a>.[9530][9534][14112] Some people only have one symptom while others may have many of the symptoms.[9534]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cause of BWS is complex and is different for different people, but involves genes that control body growth. The genes,&nbsp;&nbsp;including the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CDKN1C\" target=\"_blank\">CDKN1C</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/H19\" target=\"_blank\">H19</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IGF2\" target=\"_blank\">IGF2</a></em>, and&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/KCNQ1OT1\" target=\"_blank\">KCNQ1OT1</a>&nbsp;</em>genes, are located on chromosome 11. In most cases BWS is caused by problems with the genomic imprinting of these genes.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/inheritance/updimprinting\" target=\"_blank\">Genomic imprinting</a>  refers to having some genes that are active (expressed) only when inherited from the father and others that are active only when inherited from the mother. Less commonly, changes or mutations in the <em>CDKN1C</em> gene or larger changes to chromosome 11, such as a translocation, deletion, or duplication, may cause BWS.[9530][9534] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiagnosis of BWS is based on symptoms with the support of genetic testing. At present however, there is no clearly accepted diagnostic criteria as doctors are trying to understand the full spectrum of possible symptoms. While there is no cure for BWS, there are treatments available for many of the symptoms. Treatment may include medication for hypoglycemia, surgery to repair an omphalocele or other birth defect, or surgery to reduce size of the tongue (macroglossia repair). Early intervention, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy may also be recommended. Evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon may be helpful depending on the areas of the body affected by overgrowth.[9534] Recommended management of BWS includes screening for the development of Wilms tumor,&nbsp;rhabdomyosarcoma, and hepatoblastoma.[14112]<br />","dateModified":"2017-11-29T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13356,"questionText":"What are the symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome?","answerText":"The symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) vary from person to person.

BWS usually results from abnormal <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=generegulation\" target=\"_blank\">gene regulation</a> in a particular region of <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/11\" target=\"_blank\">chromosome 11</a>.[9530] Gene regulation is the process of turning genes \"on\" or \"off\" and ensures that the appropriate genes are expressed at the proper times.[9531]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost cases of BWS are due to abnormalities involving genes on chromosome 11 that undergo genomic imprinting (imprinted genes). Normally, people inherit one copy of each chromosome from each parent, which also means that people normally inherit one copy of each gene (on the chromosomes) from each parent. Most genes on chromosome 11 have both copies&nbsp; activated (expressed). However, for some of these genes, only the paternal copy (inherited from a person's father) is expressed, or only the maternal copy is expressed. These parent-specific differences in gene expression are due to what is known as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/inheritance/updimprinting\" target=\"_blank\">genomic imprinting</a>.[9530]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe genetic imprinting results from changes produced in a process called <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=methylation\" target=\"_blank\">methylation</a>&nbsp;(in about 50% of the cases), a chemical reaction that occurs when egg and sperm cells are formed, and which attaches molecules called \"methyl groups\" to specific pieces of DNA, inactivating a specific gene, paternal or maternal. SBW is often associated with changes in regions of DNA on chromosome 11 called imprinting centers (IC1 and IC2), which control the methylation of several genes involved in normal growth. Abnormal methylation disrupts the regulation of these genes, leading to overgrowth and the other features of BWS. The genes affected include the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CDKN1C\" target=\"_blank\"><em>CDKN1C</em></a><em></em>, <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/H19\" target=\"_blank\">H19</a></em>, <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IGF2\" target=\"_blank\">IGF2</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/KCNQ1OT1\" target=\"_blank\">KCNQ1OT1</a></em> genes.[9530][14112]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbout 20% of cases of BWS are caused by a genetic abnormality called paternal <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=uniparentaldisomy\" target=\"_blank\">uniparental disomy</a> (UPD), in which both copies of chromosome 11 are inherited from the father and no copy is inherited from the mother.  Paternal UPD  usually occurs early in embryonic development, affecting only some of the body's cells (called <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=mosaic\" target=\"_blank\">mosaicism</a>). Mosaic paternal UPD leads to an imbalance of the active genes on chromosome 11, causing the&nbsp; symptoms of the&nbsp; syndrome.[9530]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLess commonly, BWS may be caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in the <em>CDKN1C</em> gene, which gives instructions for making a <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/howgeneswork/protein\" target=\"_blank\">protein</a> that helps control growth before birth. Mutations in this gene prevent the protein from restricting growth, leading to the features of BWS.[9530]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore rarely, in about 1% of people with BWS have a chromosome abnormality, such as a <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=201\" target=\"_blank\">translocation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/duplication/\" target=\"_blank\">duplication</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=45\" target=\"_blank\">deletion</a> of genetic material on chromosome 11 (the 11p15 region).[9530][14112]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause the genetic changes responsible for BWS are very complex, people with questions about the causes and inheritance of BWS should consult with a genetics professional.[14112]","dateModified":"2017-11-29T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":9530,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"June, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9531,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Gene regulation","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"August 18, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=generegulation","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14112,"authors":"Kalish JM,  Doros L & Helman LJ","articleTitle":"Surveillance Recommendations for Children with Overgrowth Syndromes and Predisposition to Wilms Tumors and Hepatoblastoma","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"American Association of Cancer Research","date":"","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/clincanres/23/13/e115.full.pdf","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":5494,"questionText":"Is Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome inherited?","answerText":"In about 85% percent of cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), only one person in a family has been diagnosed.
