The most common feature is&nbsp;missing patches of skin (erosions)&nbsp;on the scalp, neck, hands, and feet. The skin erosions can lead to infection, scarring, and hair loss. Other features include changes in skin coloring; misshapen or absent fingernails and toenails; malformed or missing teeth;&nbsp;increased sensitivity to heat;&nbsp;hearing loss; <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001051.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cleft lip and/or palate</a>; and other facial abnormalities.
