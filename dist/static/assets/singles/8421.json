The signs and symptoms of Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome can vary, although most documented cases of people with the syndrome have severe to profound intellectual disability and other serious health problems.[1655] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPallister-Killian mosaic syndrome is usually caused by the presence of an abnormal extra <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/12\" target=\"_blank\">chromosome 12</a> called isochromosome 12p. An <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/isochromosomes.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">isochromosome</a> is a chromosome with two identical arms. Normal chromosomes have one long (q) arm and one short (p) arm, but isochromosomes have either two q arms or two p arms. Isochromosome 12p is a version of chromosome 12 made up of two p arms. Cells normally have two copies of each chromosome, one inherited from each parent. In people with Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome, cells have the two usual copies of chromosome 12, but some cells also have the isochromosome 12p. These cells have a total of four copies of all the genes on the p arm of chromosome 12. The extra genetic material from the isochromosome disrupts the normal course of development, causing the characteristic features of this disorder.[1655] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome is usually caused by an isochromosome 12p, other, more complex chromosomal changes involving chromosome 12 are responsible for the disorder in rare cases.[1655] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment depends upon the specific symptoms present in each individual. Treating medical and developmental problems early can help to optimize outcome.[12007]","dateModified":"2016-08-08T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
