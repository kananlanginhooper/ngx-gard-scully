Any joint(s) may be affected, but finger joints, wrists, and knees are most commonly affected.[13126] Symptoms during episodes may include pain,  swelling, stiffness, and redness in and around the joints.[13126] Some people may have a fever and other systemic symptoms.[13125] Between episodes, people with PR have no symptoms.[13126] The time between episodes may last from days to months.[13123]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe underlying cause of PR is not known.[13126] Some people with PR eventually develop chronic rheumatic disease, the most common being <a href=\"http://www.rheumatology.org/I-Am-A/Patient-Caregiver/Diseases-Conditions/Rheumatoid-Arthritis\" target=\"_blank\">rheumatoid arthritis</a> (RA).
