People with this condition experience vision loss over time as the cones and rods deteriorate.[3502][11484] Initial signs and symptoms that usually occur in childhood may include decreased sharpness of vision (visual acuity) and abnormal sensitivity to light (photophobia).&nbsp;These signs are usually followed by blind spots in the central field of vision (scotomas), loss of color perception, and loss of peripheral vision. Most individuals with this condition are legally blind by mid adulthood.[11484][3503]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are over 30 types of CRD caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in several different&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/genesandgenetherapy.html\" target=\"_blank\">genes</a>&nbsp;that can be inherited in many different ways including <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>, <a href=\"http://www.genetics.edu.au/factsheet/fs10\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked</a> or <a href=\"http://www.genetics.edu.au/factsheet/fs12\" target=\"_blank\">mitochondrial</a>&nbsp;patterns.[3502] CRDs are usually non-syndromic, but they may also be part of several syndromes. There is no cure for CRD; however, there may be ways to slow the disease process. Depending on the underlying cause of CRD and other associated symptoms, research may be ongoing to try to identify an effective treatment.[3503][11489]","dateModified":"2017-06-22T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":4541,"questionText":"How might cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) be treated?","answerText":"Currently, there is no treatment to stop a person with cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) from losing their vision. However, there may be treatment options that can help slow down the&nbsp;degenerative process, such as light avoidance and the use of low-vision aids. It is important that people with CRD receive support and resources to&nbsp;help them&nbsp;cope with the social and psychological impact of vision loss.[3503]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPossible future treatments for CRD may include:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/therapy/genetherapy\" target=\"_blank\">gene therapy</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=188\" target=\"_blank\">stem cell therapy</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fightingblindness.ie/cure/retinal-implant-technology/\" target=\"_blank\">retinal implants</a>.[11489][11488] Many of these therapies are still being tested in animal models of CRD.[14070] Before being approved as a treatment that will be available outside of research, a therapy must be found to be both effective and safe in people with CRD through research clinical trials.","dateModified":"2017-06-22T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":3503,"authors":"Hamel C","articleTitle":"Cone rod dystrophy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet","date":"February 2007","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=EN&Expert=1872","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11488,"authors":"Benjamin M.
