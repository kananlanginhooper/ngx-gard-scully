More specifically, people with this condition have male external genitalia, ranging from normal to <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003269.htm\" target=\"_blank\">ambiguous</a>. Other common signs and symptoms include small testes, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003165.htm\" target=\"_blank\">gynecomastia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001191.htm\" target=\"_blank\">infertility</a> due to azoospermia (lack of sperm), and health problems related to low testosterone. Less often, affected people may experience abnormalities such as undescended testes and <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001286.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypospadias</a>.
