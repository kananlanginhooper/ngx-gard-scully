It is characterized by a&nbsp;rapid speaking&nbsp;rate and inability to maintain normally expected sound, syllable, phrase, and pausing patterns while speaking. Other symptoms may include <a href=\"http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering.htm\" target=_blank>stuttering</a>; language or phonological errors (problems organizing sounds); and <a href=\"http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml\" target=_blank>attention deficits</a>.[6145][6146] The disorder seems to result from disorganized speech planning, talking too fast or in spurts, or simply being unsure of what one wants to say.[6146] Therapy generally focuses on the symptoms present in each individual and may include slowing the rate of speech and clearly producing speech sounds (articulating). Articulation and language problems are often reduced if the affected individual can achieve a slower rate of speech.[6145][6146]","dateModified":"2013-08-14T15:38:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
