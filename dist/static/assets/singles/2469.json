It grows proportionally to the child. A congenital pigmented nevus is considered giant if by adulthood it is larger than 20cm (about 8 inches) in diameter.[3659][8823] Giant congenital nevi can occur in people of any racial or ethnic background and on any area of the body.[8823] They result from localized genetic changes in the fetus that lead to excessive growth of melanocytes, the cells in the skin that are responsible for skin color.[3659] People with giant congenital nevi may have no other symptoms or may have several symptoms such as fragile, dry, or itchy skin. In about 5% to 10% of the cases the giant congenital nevus is associated with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7186/neurocutaneous-melanosis\" target=\"_blank\">neurocutaneous melanocytosis</a> (excess pigment cells in the brain or spinal cord) and is characterized by neurological symptoms. They also have an increased risk of developing <a href=\"http://dermnetnz.org/lesions/melanoma.html\" target=\"_blank\">malignant melanoma</a>, a type of skin cancer, especially if the nevus is localized in the vertebral column or when there are multiple associated lesions (satellites).[8823]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhenever possible, treatment includes surgery to remove the nevus. In other cases other treatment such as dermabrasion, shaving or facial excision, chemical peels and laser can be done. In most cases, when there are no neurological problems, the prognosis is good, but it is necessary for the lesions to be examined regularly.[14155][14158]","dateModified":"2017-12-11T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":8443,"questionText":"How might giant congenital nevus be treated?","answerText":"Treatment for giant congenital nevus depends on the age of the affected individual as well as the size, location, and thickness of the nevus. Surgery may be done to remove the nevus, particularly when there is a concern that it may develop into a melanoma.[3659] When small nevi are removed, the surrounding skin can often be pulled together with stitches. Larger nevi may need to be removed in several stages and full-thickness&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=46581\" target=\"_blank\">skin grafts</a> may be needed to help the skin heal following surgery.<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">[3659]</span><span>[8823]</span>&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen surgery is not possible, other treatment may include procedures such as curettage, dermabrasion, and ablative laser therapy which  may be used for superficial skin imperfections, including reducing pigment and hair, but cannot completely remove the nevus.[8823][14155][14156][14158]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAffected individuals should self-monitor and continue to have regular skin examinations to check for benign or malignant tumors. Early awareness will allow their physicians &nbsp;to adjust treatment protocols &nbsp;accordingly.[3659] Children are most likely to show neurological signs before primary school and can respond well to a range of symptomatic therapies.[8823]<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2017-12-11T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":3659,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Congenital melanocytic naevi","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"DermNet NZ","date":"2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://dermnetnz.org/lesions/congenital-naevus.html","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8823,"authors":"Kinsler V, Etchevers H & Price H","articleTitle":"All About Congenital Melanocytic Nevi","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Naevus Global","date":"","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.naevusglobal.org/naevus-global-english_id93.html","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14155,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Giant Congenital Melanocytic Nevus","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Organization for Rare Diseases  (NORD)","date":"2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/giant-congenital-melanocytic-nevus/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14156,"authors":"Schwartz RA","articleTitle":"Congenital Nevi Treatment & Management Updated","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"June 05, 2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1118659-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14158,"authors":"Hunt R, Shaffer JV & Bolognia JK","articleTitle":"Congenital melanocytic nevi","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"August 23, 2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-melanocytic-nevi","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[{"referenceId":8824,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Giant congenital melanocytic nevus","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"December 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/giant-congenital-melanocytic-nevus","dateAccessed":"2015-05-04T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8825,"authors":"Price H, Etchevers H","articleTitle":"Giant Congenital Melanocytic Nevus","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)","date":"2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.rarediseases.org/rare-disease-information/rare-diseases/byID/1271/viewAbstract","dateAccessed":"2015-05-04T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8827,"authors":"","articleTitle":"General Information on Giant Congenital Nevus or Naevus: What is the Risk of Cancer?","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Nevus Network","date":"January 2, 2010","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.nevusnetwork.org/nev_info.htm#WHAT IS THE RISK OF CANCER?","dateAccessed":"2015-05-04T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8823,"authors":"Kinsler V, Etchevers H & Price H","articleTitle":"All About Congenital Melanocytic Nevi","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Naevus Global","date":"","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.naevusglobal.org/naevus-global-english_id93.html","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
