The overgrowth of bone in the head can lead to distinctive facial features and delayed tooth eruption, as well as compression of the cranial nerves.[2503] The condition is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/121014\" target=\"_blank\">GJA1</a></em> gene. As the name suggests, it is inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>&nbsp;manner.[11204] Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and may include surgery to relieve cranial pressure and correct facial deformities.[11205]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2016-04-11T12:57:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":3594,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of craniometaphyseal dysplasia?","answerText":"<p>Bone overgrowth in the head causes many of the signs and symptoms of craniometaphyseal dysplasia. Affected individuals typically have distinctive facial features such as a wide nasal bridge, a prominent forehead, wide-set eyes (hypertelorism), and a prominent jaw. Excessive new bone formation (hyperostosis) in the jaw can delay teething (dentition) or result in absent teeth. Infants with this condition may have breathing or feeding problems caused by narrow nasal passages. In severe cases, abnormal bone growth can compress the nerves that emerge from the brain and extend to various areas of the head and neck (cranial nerves). Compression of the cranial nerves can lead to paralyzed facial muscles (facial nerve palsy), blindness, or deafness.[2503]</p>\r\n<p>The x-rays of individuals with craniometaphyseal dysplasia show unusually shaped long bones, particularly the large bones in the legs. The ends of these bones (metaphyses) are wider and appear less dense in people with this condition.[2503]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe symptoms seen in autosomal recessive craniometaphyseal dysplasia are typically more severe than those seen in the autosomal dominant form.[2503]</p>","dateModified":"2016-04-11T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":2503,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Craniometaphyseal dysplasia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"February 2009","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/craniometaphyseal-dysplasia","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":10484,"questionText":"What causes autosomal recessive craniometaphyseal dysplasia?","answerText":"Autosomal recessive craniometaphyseal dysplasia is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/121014\" target=\"_blank\">GJA1</a></em> gene.[11204] The GJA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called connexin43, which is one of 21 connexin proteins in humans. Connexins lay a role in cell-to-cell communication by forming channels, or gap junctions, between cells. Gap junctions allow for the transport of nutrients, charged particles (ions), and other small molecules that carry necessary communication signals between cells. Connexin43 is found in many human tissues, including eyes, skin, bine, ears, heart, and brain.[11215]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMutations in the <em>GJA1</em> gene that cause autosomal recessive craniometaphyseal dysplasia appear to disrupt bone remodeling.
