MRS may be characterized by three main features: recurrent <a href=\"https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/brain,-spinal-cord,-and-nerve-disorders/cranial-nerve-disorders/bell-palsy\" target=\"_blank\">facial nerve palsy</a>, episodes of swelling of the&nbsp;face and lips, and fissuring of the tongue (formation of deep grooves). The majority of people with MRS only have one or two of these features, rather than all three.[14983][3933] The age when symptoms begin and frequency of episodes varies from person to person (even within the same family), but usually symptoms begin during childhood or early adolescence.[14983][3933] Recurrent episodes may lead to worsening and persistent swelling, which may become permanent.[3933] MRS is more common in females than in males.[14983]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInheritance of MRS is autosomal dominant, but a consistent genetic cause has not been found. It is possible that more than one gene is responsible for MRS, and/or that environmental \"triggers\" may contribute to causing the syndrome in some genetically predisposed individuals.[14983] In some cases, MRS may be associated with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10232/crohns-disease\" target=\"_blank\">Crohn's disease</a> or <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7607/sarcoidosis\" target=\"_blank\">sarcoidosis</a>.[3933]&nbsp;MRS is diagnosed based on the symptoms present and medical history, and a biopsy of the lips may be needed to confirm the diagnosis in some cases.[14985]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment for MRS aims to relieve symptoms, but the effectiveness of current treatment options has not been well-established.[14984] Treatment options may include medications to reduce swelling (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  and corticosteroids),  antibiotics, immunosuppressants, surgery (to relieve pressure on the facial nerves and reduce swelling), and facial rehabilitation (which may involve physiotherapy and speech-language therapy).[3933][14986]","dateModified":"2018-10-15T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":13106,"relatedDiseaseName":"Orofacial Granulomatosis","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
