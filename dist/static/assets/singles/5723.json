Both forms lead&nbsp;to the inability to absorb zinc from the intestine. The lack of zinc can cause skin inflammation with a rash (pustular dermatitis) around the mouth and/or anus; diarrhea; and abnormal nails (nail dystrophy). Irritability and emotional disturbances can also occur. The inherited form is&nbsp;caused by <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\">mutations</a>&nbsp;in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SLC39A4\" target=_blank>SLC39A4</a></em> gene and inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=_blank>autosomal recessive</a>&nbsp;pattern.&nbsp;The acquired form can result from diets lacking the appropriate amount of zinc.
