This syndrome has three characteristic features: a red birthmark called a <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001475.htm\" target=\"_blank\">port-wine stain</a>,&nbsp;overgrowth of soft tissues and bones, and vein malformations such as <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/varicoseveins.html\" target=\"_blank\">varicose veins</a> or malformations of deep veins in the limbs. The overgrowth of bones and soft tissues usually begins in infancy and is most often only affects one leg. However, it can also affect the arms or sometimes the upper body area (torso). The overgrowth can cause pain, a feeling of heaviness, and make the affected leg (or arm) hard to move.[3622] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost, if not all, cases of KTS are caused by <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=46586\" target=\"_blank\">somatic mutations</a>  in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PIK3CA\" target=\"_blank\"><em>PIK3CA</em></a> gene.

Since somatic mutations are only present in some of the body's cells, the signs and symptoms of KTS usually only affect specific areas of the body.[3622][10610][10611] The<em> PIK3CA</em> gene provides instructions for making a protein which is part of an enzyme that is important for cell growth and division (proliferation), movement (migration) of cells, and cell survival.
