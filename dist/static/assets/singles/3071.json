Males with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism are often born with an unusually small penis and undescended testes. At puberty, most affected individuals do not develop secondary sex characteristics, such as the growth of facial hair and deepening of the voice in males. Affected females usually do not begin menstruating at puberty and have little or no breast development. In some people, puberty is incomplete or delayed.[3297] \r\n<p>In Kallmann syndrome 1, the sense of smell is either diminished or completely absent. This feature distinguishes Kallmann syndrome from most other forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which do not affect the sense of smell.
