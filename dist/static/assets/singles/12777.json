Specific symptoms (especially those not involving the nervous system) and severity vary from person to person, but most children develop severe developmental delay and intellectual disability. This condition is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PIGA\" target=\"_blank\">PIGA</a></em> gene on the X chromosome&nbsp;and inheritance is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002051.htm\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked recessive</a>, so it typically affects boys.[9739] However, in some cases, MCAHS2 is not inherited from a parent and is the result of a new mutation occurring for the first time in a person with MCAHS2 (a <em>de novo</em> mutation).[14652] Treatment depends on the symptoms present and aims to control symptoms and increase quality of life. The long-term outlook and life expectancy varies depending on severity. Some children with MCAHS2 do not survive beyond infancy.[14653]","dateModified":"2018-05-21T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12782,"relatedDiseaseName":"Congenital disorder of glycosylation with developmental anomaly","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":12783,"relatedDiseaseName":"PIGA deficiency","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
