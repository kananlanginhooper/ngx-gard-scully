As a result of these abnormalities, the sperm are unable to fertilize an egg cell, leading to male factor infertility.[11136] Approximately 70% of men with globozoospermia have changes (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>) in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DPY19L2\" target=\"_blank\">DPY19L2</a></em> gene, which are inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> manner.
