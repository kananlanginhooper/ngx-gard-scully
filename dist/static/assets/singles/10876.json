In type 1, the fusion involves 2-6 cm of the area between the radius and ulna bones which is closer to the elbow and the knobby end of the radius that meets the elbow is absent (radial head). In type 2,&nbsp;the fusion is farther from the elbow and there is dislocation of the radial head. Both types result in a limitation of inward roll (pronation) and outward roll (supination) of the forearm, and in type 2 there is also a restriction of extension at the elbow.[5508] Congenital radioulnar synostosis is due to abnormal fetal development of the forearm bones, but the underlying cause is not always known. It is sometimes a feature of certain <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/11508982#al-5\" target=\"_blank\">chromosome abnormalities</a>&nbsp;or genetic syndromes.[5506][5507][5508] Some cases appear to&nbsp;be inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner.[5508] Treatment may be conservative or involve surgery depending on the severity of the abnormality and the range of motion.[5506]","dateModified":"2017-07-11T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6433,"questionText":"What causes congenital radioulnar synostosis?","answerText":"Congenital radioulnar synostosis is caused by abnormal development of the forearm bones during the fetal period, although the underlying cause of the developmental abnormality is not always known.

Surgery is more commonly performed in patients who have bilateral radioulnar synostosis and/or patients who have very limited movement due to the radioulnar synostosis. In some cases, surgery is best performed in early childhood, usually before school starts, and in some cases it may need to be done in several stages. Surgery is not generally recommended for older patients with milder deformities who have learned to compensate for the limited range of movement caused by the synostosis, by using their shoulders and/or wrists.
