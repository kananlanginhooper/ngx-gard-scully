NCPH typically is less severe than portal hypertension caused by cirrhosis.[15171] Symptoms of portal hypertension may include fatigue, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/edema.html\" target=\"_blank\">edema</a>, itching, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/jaundice.html\" target=\"_blank\">jaundice</a>, and abdominal discomfort or swelling due to fluid build-up (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000286.htm\" target=\"_blank\">ascites</a>). Complications that may develop include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000268.htm\" target=\"_blank\">bleeding esophageal varices</a> and an enlarged and overactive spleen (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001314.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypersplenism</a>).[15167][15171][15172] Liver function in most people with NRH remains normal (even in those who develop NCPH), and liver failure in people with NRH and NCPH is rare.[15170][15171]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cause of NRH is not well-understood.[15171] It is thought that the liver&rsquo;s blood vessels somehow become damaged or inflamed, impairing blood flow to parts of the liver. This in turn may cause cells in adjacent parts to &ldquo;overcompensate&rdquo; and replicate more than they should, leading to NRH.[15168][15171] While some people with NRH have no known underlying health problems, NRH is often associated with <a href=\"https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/arthritis-and-rheumatic-diseases\" target=\"_blank\">rheumatic</a>, autoimmune, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/blooddisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">hematologic</a> (blood-related), and <a href=\"https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/blood-disorders/myeloproliferative-disorders/overview-of-myeloproliferative-disorders\" target=\"_blank\">myeloproliferativ</a>e disorders; chronic or recurrent infections; immune deficiency; or exposure to certain medications or toxins.[15167][15170][15171] NRH may be diagnosed based on signs and symptoms (when present), liver function tests (which usually are normal), medical history (including drug or toxin exposure), imaging studies, and liver biopsy (to rule out cirrhosis).[15171] Treatment for people with NCPH may involve starting medications to prevent or treat bleeding esophageal varices, stopping medications associated with NCPH, and treating underlying health conditions associated with NCPH.[15171] The long-term outlook for people with NRH depends on whether an underlying health problem is present and whether NCPH and its complications develop (which cannot be predicted).[15168][15170][15171] A small proportion of people eventually need a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003006.htm\" target=\"_blank\">liver transplant</a>.[15171]","dateModified":"2019-01-08T09:51:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
