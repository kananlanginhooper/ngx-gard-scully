This disorder is characterized by the sudden onset of facial paralysis that often affects just one side and can cause significant facial distortion. Symptoms vary, but may include twitching, weakness, drooping eyelid or corner of the mouth, drooling, dry eye or mouth, impairment of taste, and excessive tearing in the eye. While the exact cause is unknown, many researchers believe that a virus may lead to swelling of the 7th cranial nerve. Steroids, such as prednisone, may reduce the inflammation and swelling.[1766][1767] Other medications used to treat Bell's palsy include acyclovir (to fight viral infections) and aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen (to relieve pain).[1767] Physical therapy, facial massage and acupuncture have also been used.[1766][1767]<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2016-01-22T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":2718,"questionText":"What are the symptoms of Bell's palsy?","answerText":"<div class=\"rxbodyfield\" xmlns:o=\"urn:www.microsoft.com/office\" xmlns:st1=\"urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags\" xmlns:w=\"urn:www.microsoft.com/word\">\r\n<p>Because the facial nerve has so many functions and is so complex, damage to the nerve or a disruption in its function can lead to many problems.
