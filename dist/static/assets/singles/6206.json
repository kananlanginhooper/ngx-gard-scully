This prevents normal growth of the skull, which can affect the shape of the head and face.

The severity of signs and symptoms can vary among affected people, even within a family.

However, in at least one family, it appeared that the responsible mutation did not affect every family member who had it.[11677] For this reason,&nbsp;Crouzon syndrome has been described by some as having&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/inheritance/penetranceexpressivity\" target=\"_blank\">variable penetrance and expressivity</a>, even within families.[11676][11677][11678] When a condition has variable (or reduced) penetrance, it means that not every person with a mutation in the responsible gene will have apparent signs and symptoms of the condition. When a condition has variable expressivity, it means that not all people who do have features will be affected the same way - there is a range of possible features and severity. While extremely uncommon, it may be possible for family members with a mutation to \"appear\" unaffected, with very mild or unnoticeable features.[11677] Therefore, whether an unaffected sibling is at risk to have an affected child may depend on&nbsp;whether the sibling has a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a>&nbsp;in the responsible gene.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf an apparently unaffected sibling is confirmed to not have the mutation that is present in an affected family member, he/she is not considered at risk to have an affected child. In other words, a person cannot pass on a mutation that he/she does not have. <strong>Based on most reports in the literature, people without features of Crouzon syndrome typically do not carry a mutation in the responsible gene</strong>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf an apparently unaffected sibling does have the mutation that is present in an affected family member, he/she has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to pass the mutation on to each child.
