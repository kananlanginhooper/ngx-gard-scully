Individuals who are diagnosed early in life and begin treatment before the onset of symptoms will likely have the best outcome. For this reason, newborn siblings of children with GAMT deficiency should begin treatment right away until it can be determined whether or not they have GAMT deficiency as well.[9944] Many researchers are also hoping that GAMT deficiency can be added to <a href=\"http://www.babysfirsttest.org/newborn-screening/screening-101\">newborn screening</a> programs.
