The Rh antigens maintain the integrity of the RBC membrane and therefore, RBCs which lack Rh antigens have an abnormal shape. There are two types of Rh deficiency syndrome:[10568]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The regulator type is associated with many different changes (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>) in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/RHAG\" target=\"_blank\">RHAG</a> <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a> .&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>The amorph type is caused by inactive copies of a gene (silent alleles) at the <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/5477772_fig1_Fig-1-Structure-of-the-RH-locus-and-some-well-characterized-variantsA-in-RhD-positive\" target=\"_blank\">RH locus</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAs a result, the RBCs do not express any of the Rh antigens. The absence of the Rh complex alters the RBC shape, increases its tendency to break down (osmotic fragility), and shortens its lifespan, resulting in a <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000571.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hemolytic anemia</a> that is usually mild.
