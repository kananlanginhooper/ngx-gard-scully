People with this condition generally develop large papules with central keratin (a protein found in the skin, hair and nails) plugs throughout their body. These lesions are typically not painful but may cause severe itching. Although it can affect both men and women throughout life, the average age of onset is 30 years. The cause of the disease is currently unknown; however, it is often associated with certain conditions such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001214.htm\" target=\"_blank\">diabetes mellitus</a>, kidney disease, liver abnormalities, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000158.htm\" target=\"_blank\">congestive heart failure</a>.
