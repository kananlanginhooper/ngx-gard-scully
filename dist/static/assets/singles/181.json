It affects the macula, an area of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. Vision loss is due to abnormal accumulation of a fatty yellow pigment (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002242.htm\" target=\"_blank\">lipofuscin</a>) in the cells within the macula. People with Stargardt disease also have problems with night vision, and some have problems with color vision. The signs and symptoms of Stargardt disease typically appear in late childhood to early adulthood and worsen over time.[3073] It is most commonly caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ABCA4\" target=\"_blank\"><em>ABCA4</em></a> gene and inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> manner.
