Although this condition can occur in people of all ages, it is most commonly diagnosed in the third or fourth decade of life.[10454][10455] The severity of the condition varies from person to person with some affected people experiencing a mild form that resolves on its own and others experiencing a severe form that may progress to vitreous hemorrhage (leakage of blood into the eye), vision loss and/or <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001620.htm\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">glaucoma</a>. The underlying cause of IRVAN syndrome is currently unknown. Most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Treatment varies based on the severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms. In severe cases, surgery or medications such as corticosteroids may be recommended.[10454]","dateModified":"2016-01-21T10:51:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":10227,"authors":"Paciuc-Beja M, Santos-Cantu D, Groman-Lupa S & Quiroz-Mercado H","articleTitle":"Current Concepts of IRVAN Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"EC Ophthalmology","date":"2015","volume":"1(1)","pages":"4-7","url":"https://www.ecronicon.com/ecop/ophthalmology-ECOP-01-00002.php","dateAccessed":"2015-12-15T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
