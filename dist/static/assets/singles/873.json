People with this disease experience progressive muscle weakness and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003185.htm\">joint stiffness (contractures)</a>&nbsp;in their fingers, wrists, elbows, and ankles. The features of Bethlem myopathy can appear at any age. In some cases, the symptoms start before birth with decreased fetal movements. In others, low muscle tone (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003298.htm\">hypotonia</a>) and a stiff neck (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000749.htm\">torticollis</a>) develop during infancy. During childhood,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/devdel.htm\">developmental delay</a>&nbsp;may be noted. For example a baby with Bethlem myopahy may learn to sit by themselves or walk later than usual. In some, symptoms don&rsquo;t occur until adulthood, when a person may notice muscle weakness. By the age of 50-years-old, approximately two-thirds (66%) of people with Bethlem myopathy will need to use a walker, cane, or wheelchair.[8210][8211]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to the muscle problems, some people with Bethlem myopathy have skin abnormalities. These abnormalities may include small bumps called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.healthline.com/health/hyperkeratosis\">follicular hyperkeratosis</a>&nbsp;that develop around the elbows and knees or soft, velvety skin on the palms and soles. Some people may also have wounds that split open with little bleeding and widen over time to create shallow scars.[8210] Rarely, individuals with Bethlem myopathy may develop breathing problems as the disease progresses.[8211]","dateModified":"2017-09-08T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":8210,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Collagen VI-related myopathy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"October 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/collagen-vi-related-myopathy","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8211,"authors":"Lampe AK, Flanigan KM, Bushby KM, Hicks D","articleTitle":"Collagen Type VI-Related Disorders","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"August 9, 2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1503/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":8246,"questionText":"How might Bethlem myopathy be treated?","answerText":"Treatment for Bethlem myopathy is symptomatic and supportive.
