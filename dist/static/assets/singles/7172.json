This is also called iron overload. Accumulation of iron in the organs is toxic and can cause organ damage. In this form of hemochromatosis, the iron overload begins before birth. This disease tends to progress rapidly and is characterized by <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/liverdiseases.html\">liver damage</a> that is apparent at birth or in the first days of life. Babies with the disease may be born very early (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/prematurebabies.html\">premature</a>) or struggle to grow in the womb (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001500.htm\">intrauterine growth restriction</a>). Symptoms of neonatal hemochromatosis may include low blood sugar (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/hypoglycemia.html\">hypoglycemia</a>), abnormalities in blood clotting, yellowing of the skin and eyes (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/jaundice.html\">jaundice</a>), and swelling (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/edema.html\">edema</a>).[10047]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe exact cause of neonatal hemochromatosis is unknown.

If a woman had a baby with neonatal hemochromatosis, each future child has an 80% chance to have the disease as well. A diagnosis of neonatal hemochromatosis is suspected when a doctor observes signs and symptoms of hemochromatosis or liver disease in a newborn. A doctor may decide to order laboratory tests including a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003895.htm\">liver biopsy</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003335.htm\">MRI</a>, or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003488.htm\">blood test</a>.[10047] Treatment options may include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002923.htm\">blood exchange transfusion</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-and-treatments/library/immune-deficiencies-library/ivig\">intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy,</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/livertransplantation.html\">liver transplant</a>.[10047] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo learn more about other types of hemochromatosis click on the disease names below:<br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10417/disease\">Hemochromatosis type 1</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Disease.aspx?diseaseID=10092\" target=\"_blank\">Hemochromatosis type 2</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10093/hemochromatosis-type-3\">Hemochromatosis type 3</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/13472/hemochromatosis-type-5\" target=\"_blank\">Hemochromatosis type 5</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Disease.aspx?diseaseID=7172\" target=\"_blank\">Neonatal hemochromatosis</a></li>\r\n</ul>","dateModified":"2018-02-18T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":12606,"questionText":"What causes neonatal hemochromatosis?","answerText":"The exact cause of neonatal hemochromatosis is unknown.
