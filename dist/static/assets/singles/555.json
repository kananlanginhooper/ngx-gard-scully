One of the main signs of this disorder is adrenal insufficiency, which occurs when the <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002219.htm\" target=_blank>adrenal glands</a> do not produce enough hormones. <a href=\"http://endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/addison/addison.aspx\" target=_blank>Adrenal insufficiency</a> typically begins in infancy or childhood and can cause vomiting, difficulty with feeding, dehydration, extremely low blood sugar (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000386.htm\" target=_blank>hypoglycemia</a>), and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000039.htm\" target=_blank>shock</a>.

The <span class=geneSymbol><em>NR0B1</em></span> gene provides instructions to make a protein called DAX1.

A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.[5396] \r\n<p>In X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one mutated copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier.
