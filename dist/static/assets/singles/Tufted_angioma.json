Some cases of tufted angioma have been reported in the mother during pregnancy, whereas in other cases the tufted angioma may be congenital. The lesions occur predominantly on the neck, shoulders, and trunk and appear histologically in a 'cannonball' distribution of rounded nodules or tufts of capillary-sized vessels in the dermis, with lymphatic vessels present at the periphery. The natural history is slow progressive growth, after which it tends to remain stable in size. Regression has been reported in some cases. Tufted angioma should be distinguished from kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KHE). Multiple tufted angioma and KHE may be associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome (141000), which is characterized by severe thrombocytopenia and consumption of coagulation factors (summary by Tille et al., 2003).","Disease__c":"Tufted angioma","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C0346073","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
