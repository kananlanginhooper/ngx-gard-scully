In myelodysplastic diseases, the blood stem cells do not mature into healthy red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets and as a result,&nbsp;there are fewer of these healthy cells. In myeloproliferative diseases, a greater than normal number of blood stem cells develop into one or more types of blood cells and the total number of blood cells slowly increases. The 3 main types of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases&nbsp;include <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/mds-mpd/HealthProfessional/page2\" target=_blank>chronic myelomonocytic leukemia</a> (CMML); <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/mds-mpd/Patient/page3\" target=_blank>juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia</a> (JMML); and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/mds-mpd/Patient/page4\" target=_blank>atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia</a> (aCML). When a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease does not match any of these types, it is called <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/mds-mpd/Patient/page5\" target=_blank>myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassifiable</a> (MDS/MPN-UC). Symptoms of CMML and JMML may include fever, feeling tired and weight loss. Symptoms of aCML may include easy bruising or bleeding and feeling tired or weak. Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases may progress to acute leukemia. There are different types of treatment for individuals with one of these diseases, which may include chemotherapy, another drug therapy, stem cell transplant and/or supportive care.[3791]","dateModified":"2011-07-07T14:55:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":4838,"questionText":"What causes myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease?","answerText":"In most cases, the cause of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease is unknown, and there is limited information regarding potential causes. No specific genetic defects have been identified for any of the diseases. The specific cause of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is unknown, but exposure to occupational and environmental carcinogens (agents that can cause cancer), ionizing radiation, and cytotoxic agents (agents that are toxic to cells) have been associated in some cases.
