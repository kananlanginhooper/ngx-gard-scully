This results in elevated, dark spiny papules on the head, face (usually the nose), and trunk. In this condition, there are numerous tiny open pores filled with multiple tiny short hairs, usually only visible with a magnifying glass. TS usually does not cause problems and&nbsp;may only be noticed as an incidental finding.
