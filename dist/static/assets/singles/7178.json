In babies, early recognition is very important because treatment can avoid the physical and intellectual disability that results from repeated episodes of dehydration and high levels of sodium (hypernatremia). Infants and very young children should be offered water every two hours during the day and night. In severe cases, continuous gastric feeding may be required. In adults, the decision to treat is based upon the individual patient's intolerance of the polyuria and polydipsia since, in almost all patients, the thirst mechanism is sufficient to maintain the  sodium in the high-normal range. The medication desmopressin&nbsp;may be tried in patients who have persistent symptomatic polyuria after having the above described regimen.&nbsp;Several new approaches to treatment of this disorder are being investigated: V2 receptor chaperones and V2 receptor bypass.[4012][12829]</span></p>","dateModified":"2016-12-23T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":4012,"authors":"Knoers N","articleTitle":"Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"2010","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1177/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12829,"authors":"Bichet DG","articleTitle":"Treatment of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"January 07, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-nephrogenic-diabetes-insipidus","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":5013,"questionText":"Will my son need to take medication to treat nephrogenic diabetes insipidus for the rest of his life?","answerText":"This depends of the underlying cause of your son's condition.
