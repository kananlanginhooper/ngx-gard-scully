It is used in all the body&rsquo;s organs. People with variegate porphyria have abnormal production of heme. They are very sensitive to sun exposure (<a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/sun-allergy-photosensitivity-a-to-z \" target=\"_blank\">photosensitive</a>) and develop skin blisters and sores when they are exposed to sunlight. People with variegate porphyria can also have neurological symptoms in the form of episodes (acute attacks) of severe stomach pain, nausea and vomiting.[2416][2415] Symptoms usually begin in adulthood. Variegate porphyria is caused by mutations in the <em>PPOX</em> gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.&nbsp; Some people who have <em>PPOX</em> gene mutations never have symptoms of porphyria. People with variegate porphyria need to avoid sun exposure. Attacks are treated with medication and hospitalization. Attacks can be prevented by avoiding the factors that cause the symptoms.[2416][2415]","dateModified":"2018-12-17T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":3469,"questionText":"What are the symptoms of variegate porphyria?","answerText":"Symptoms of variegate porphyria vary from person to person. This condition most often causes skin symptoms, neurological symptoms, or both. The symptoms usually start in adulthood. Skin symptoms are related to sun sensitivity and people with variegate porphyria may develop blisters, sores and discoloration after sun exposure.[2416][2415] Neurological symptoms are related to acute attacks which may occur after exposure to certain medications, hormonal changes, dieting, or alcohol. For some people, the exact cause for an attack may not be known. During an acute attack of variegate porphyria, a person may experience abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea. Muscle weakness, seizures, and increased heart rate and blood pressure may also occur.&nbsp; Mental changes such as anxiety and hallucinations have been reported as being part of an acute attack, but these are no longer considered part of this condition.[15125]. Attacks vary in length from a few days to weeks. After an attack, most of the symptoms go away fairly quickly. Some symptoms, such as muscle weakness may take months to get better.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHepatocelluar carcinoma has been reported as a rare complication of variegate porphyria.[2415] This is a type of cancer that starts in the liver.
