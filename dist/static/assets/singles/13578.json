There is also a low numbers of at least one type of blood cell. The early forms of cell types in the bone marrow (red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets) may or may not look abnormal (dysplasia) under the microscope. Signs and symptoms may include a very hard to treat and persistent anemia (refractory anemia),  frequent infections (due to low numbers of neutrophils), easy bruising and bleeding (due to low number or abnormal platelets).
