The features in affected people vary. Craniosynostosis can give the head a pointed appearance; cause asymmetry of the head and face; affect the development of the brain; and cause characteristic facial features. Other signs and symptoms may include dental abnormalities; vision problems; hearing loss; heart defects; genital abnormalities; obesity; various skeletal abnormalities; and a range of intellectual disability.

Facial features may include a flat nasal bridge; down-slanting palpebral fissures (the outside corners of the eye); low-set and abnormally shaped ears; underdeveloped jaws; and abnormal eye shape. Vision problems are common. Some people also have dental abnormalities such as small baby teeth. Abnormalities of the fingers and toes may include fusion of the skin between digits; short digits; or extra digits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther signs and symptoms may include obesity, umbilical hernia, hearing loss, heart defects, and other skeletal abnormalities such as as deformed hips, <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/kyphoscoliosis\" target=\"_blank\">kyphoscoliosis</a>, and knees that angle inward.
