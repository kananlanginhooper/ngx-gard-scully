It represents the most severe end of a phenotypic spectrum of similar disorders resulting from defective glycosylation of DAG1 (128239), collectively known as 'dystroglycanopathies' (summary by Godfrey et al., 2007).For a general phenotypic description and a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy type A, see MDDGA1 (236670).","Disease__c":"Muscle eye brain disease","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C0457133","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
