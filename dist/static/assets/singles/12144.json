Features can range from mild to severe. In most cases, dystonia begins in the lower limbs and spreads to the upper limbs over time. Symptoms may include unusual limb positioning; a lack of coordination when walking or running; sleep problems; and episodes of depression. Affected people also often develop a group of movement abnormalities called <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/parkinsonism/expert-answers/FAQ-20058490?p=1\" target=\"_blank\">parkinsonism</a>. Although movement difficulties usually worsen with age, they often stabilize around age 30. DRD may be caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GCH1\" target=\"_blank\">GCH1</a>, <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TH\" target=\"_blank\">TH</a></em> or <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SPR\" target=\"_blank\">SPR</a></em> genes, or the cause may be unknown.

This form of DRD is usually characterized by childhood-onset dystonia that may be associated with <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/parkinsonism/expert-answers/FAQ-20058490?p=1\" target=\"_blank\">parkinsonism</a> at an older age. The average age of onset is 6 years, and females are 2-4 times more likely than males to be affected. Symptoms usually begin with lower limb dystonia, resulting in gait problems that can cause stumbling and falling. Symptoms are often worse later in the day, a phenomenon known as diurnal fluctuation. In rare cases, the first symptom may be arm dystonia, tremor of the hands, slowness of movements, or cervical dystonia. This form of DRD usually progresses to affect the whole body, and some people also develop parkinsonism. Depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances and obsessive-compulsive disorder have been reported in some people. Intellectual function is normal. Those with onset at older ages tend to be more mildly affected.[8803]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother form of DRD is due to a rare condition called <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10365/sepiapterin-reductase-deficiency/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">sepiapterin reductase deficiency</a>, which is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> manner.

This form is characterized by a spectrum of symptoms, ranging from those seen in the autosomal dominant form to progressive infantile <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/encephalopathy/encephalopathy.htm\" target=\"_blank\">encephalopathy</a>.

It is generally agreed that people with childhood-onset dystonia of unknown cause should be treated initially with levodopa.

There is only one gene in which mutations are known to cause this form of DRD, but not all people with the disorder are found to have a mutation in the responsible gene. While finding a mutation may provide information about prognosis, it does not alter the treatment.
