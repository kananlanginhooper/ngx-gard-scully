This process may occur weeks or even months after the&nbsp;infection has resolved.[5133][5134]&nbsp;In addition to&nbsp;joint inflammation, reactive arthritis is associated with two other symptoms: redness and inflammation of the eyes (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/pinkeye.html\" target=_blank>conjunctivitis</a>) and inflammation of the urinary tract (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000439.htm\" target=_blank>urethritis</a>). These symptoms may occur alone, together, or not at all. The symptoms of reactive arthritis usually last 3 to 12 months, although symptoms can return or develop into a long-term disease in a small percentage of people.[5133]&nbsp;The exact cause of reactive arthritis is unknown.
