Mitochondria are specialized compartments in cells that create more than 90% of the energy needed by the body. In mitochondrial diseases, the mitochondria don't work correctly resulting in less energy in the cell, cell injury and cell death. Complex I is the first step in a chain reaction in mitochondria leading to energy production. Signs and symptoms of complex I deficiency vary widely in nature and severity, ranging from lethal neonatal disease to adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Features may include macrocephaly (large head) with progressive <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Leukodystrophy-Information-Page\" target=\"_blank\">leukodystrophy</a>, encephalopathy, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000192.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Mitochondrial-Myopathy-Fact-Sheet\" target=\"_blank\">myopathy</a>, liver disease, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6877/leigh-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Leigh syndrome</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6870/leber-hereditary-optic-neuropathy\" target=\"_blank\">Leber hereditary optic neuropathy</a>, and some forms of <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10251/parkinson-disease\" target=\"_blank\">Parkinson disease</a>.
