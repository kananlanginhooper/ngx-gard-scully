This disorder can be severe, moderate, or mild. In severe cases, heavy bleeding occurs after minor injury or even when there is no injury (spontaneous bleeding). Bleeding into the joints, muscles, brain, or organs can cause pain and other serious complications. In milder forms, there is no spontaneous bleeding, and the disorder might only be diagnosed after a surgery or serious injury. Hemophilia A is caused by having low levels of a protein called factor VIII. Factor VIII is needed to form blood clots. The disorder is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner and is caused by changes (mutations) in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/F8\" target=\"_blank\"><em>F8</em> gene</a>.[8528][5891] The diagnosis of hemophilia A is made through clinical symptoms and specific laboratory tests to measure the amount of clotting factors in the blood. The main treatment is replacement therapy, during which clotting factor VIII is dripped or injected slowly into a vein.[5891][5890] Hemophilia A mainly affects males. With treatment, most people with this disorder do well. Some people with severe hemophilia A may have a shortened lifespan due to the presence of other health conditions and rare complications of the disorder.[5890]","dateModified":"2018-12-03T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13069,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of hemophilia A?&nbsp;","answerText":"The symptoms of hemophilia A and the age symptoms appear vary depending on the amount of factor VIII a person&rsquo;s body makes.

Other symptoms of the severe form include bleeding without any known cause (spontaneous bleeding) into the muscles, joints, and organs. Children with the moderate form may bruise easily and bleed too much after minor injuries, dental work, or surgery. People with the mild form of hemophilia A may not be diagnosed until they bleed more than normal after a major injury or surgery.

In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation needs to occur in both copies of the <em>F8</em> gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two mutated copies of this gene, hemophilia A, like other X-linked recessive disorders, affects males much more frequently than females.

Treatment may include medications and replacing the missing clotting factor (replacement therapy). This type of replacement therapy is done by slowly injecting or dripping concentrated factor VIII into a vein (intravenous infusion). The type and frequency of treatment often depends on the severity of the disorder in each person.[5891][8536]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople with mild or moderate hemophilia A may be treated with replacement therapy as needed (for example, when a bleeding episode occurs).

Drugs known as <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/antifibrinolytic-agent \" target=\"_blank\">antifibrinolytics</a>, which slow the breakdown of clotting factors in the blood, can also be used to treat a mild form of the disorder.[8531]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome people with severe hemophilia A may receive regular factor VIII replacement therapy to prevent bleeding episodes and other complications such as joint damage. This is referred to as prophylactic or preventative therapy. These factor VIII infusions may be done as often as necessary depending on the severity.[5891][8531] The immune system of some people with the severe form of hemophilia A may start to make antibodies (inhibitors) that prevent the replacement factor VIII from working.[8531][8536] Treatment for these people includes larger doses of replacement factor VIII and/or medications that may help block the inhibitors.[8536]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInfusions of replacement Factor VIII can be given at home.
