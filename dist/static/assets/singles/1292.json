The age-related chondrocalcinosis is quite common, whereas chondrocalcinosis 2 is not.[8208] In addition, people with chondrocalcinosis 2 are more likely to have symptoms that develop earlier in adulthood than the age-related form.[8206].<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChondrocalcinosis 2 is caused by changes in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ANKH\"><em>ANKH</em></a><em> </em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/gene\">gene</a>.
