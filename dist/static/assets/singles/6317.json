The risk&nbsp;for parents to have an affected child depends on the inheritance pattern of the specific type of ectodermal dysplasia with which the&nbsp;individual in the&nbsp;family has been diagnosed. Thus, a family affected by an ectodermal dysplasia should consider&nbsp;speaking&nbsp;with a geneticist or a genetic counselor for a better understanding of the specific ectodermal dysplasia and the probabilities or risks that the ectodermal dysplasia will occur in any future pregnancy.[3330]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe different types of inheritance patterns that occur depending on the specific type of ectodermal dysplasia in the family include <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002051.htm\" target=\"_blank\">x-linked recessive</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>.<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>X-linked recessive: If a woman is a carrier of an x-linked recessive form, there is a 50% chance that each of her male children will inherit the mutated gene and be affected, and a 50% chance that each female will inherit the mutated gene and be a carrier (like the mother). If a man has the mutated gene, he will be affected and will also pass the gene on to all of his daughters, who&nbsp;will be <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/?id=23\" target=\"_blank\">carriers</a>. Since the gene is on the <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=208\" target=\"_blank\">X chromosome</a>, his sons will not be affected because they receive the man&rsquo;s Y.[3330]\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Autosomal dominant: When the ectodermal dysplasia is an autosomal dominant form, the parent who is affected has a single copy of the mutated gene (which is sufficient to cause the disorder in&nbsp;any autosomal dominant condition)&nbsp;and may pass it on to his or her children. Regardless of the gender of the parent or the child, there is a 50% chance for each child to receive the mutated gene and be affected, and a 50% chance to not inherited the mutated gene. All children who receive the mutated gene will be affected.[3330]\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Autosomal recessive: When the ectodermal dysplasia in the family is an autosomal recessive form, the usual situation is that each parent is unaffected, but likely has one mutated copy of the gene and one normal copy of the gene. They are&nbsp;said to be carriers.[3330] Carriers do not typically show signs and symptoms of an autosomal recessive condition. When two parents who are carriers have children, with each pregnancy there is a 25% (1 in 4) risk for the child to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk for the child to be an unaffected&nbsp;carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance for the child to&nbsp;not have the condition AND not be a carrier (and therefore not pass the mutation on to future generations).

Usually, in this case, there is little chance (about 1%) that it will occur in another child of the same parents. However, the affected child may transmit the disease-causing gene to future generations.[3330] It is also important to know that e<span>ven in families and individuals who have the exact same
