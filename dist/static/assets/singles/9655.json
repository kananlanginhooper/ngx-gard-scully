This condition may occur due to many different causes, such as head injury, viral infections, or  neurological disorders. In some people with hyperacusis, sounds are perceived as being much louder than they would be by someone without this disorder. Some people may have emotional reactions to sounds, such as being annoyed or afraid. Others experience pain with low-level sounds. People with hyperacusis can have only one or different combinations of these symptoms. Another very common symptom is ringing in the ears (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/tinnitus.html\" target=\"_blank\">tinnitus</a>).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPatients with hyperacusis typically first receive an otolaryngologic exam and hearing testing. These tests can be done by an Audiologist or an Otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat doctor). Treatment may involve&nbsp;a program of sound therapy to train the brain to better process everyday sounds. This type of treatment involves listening to low-level white noise to gradually improve the ability to hear sounds.[14185][14186]<br />","dateModified":"2017-12-21T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
