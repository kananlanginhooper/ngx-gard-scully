Treatment may involve an antiviral drug such as <span><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a681045.html\">acyclovir</a></span> to treat and prevent recurrent episodes of viral meningitis, as well as various medications to treat specific symptoms present in each person.[15220][15221] While antiviral drugs have reportedly improved symptoms in many cases, the effectiveness of antiviral therapy is difficult to measure due to the rarity of the disease and its recurrent and spontaneous nature.[15220] While aseptic meningitis usually is not fatal, serious complications such as <span><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/encephalitis.html\">encephalitis</a></span> and coma can develop in severe cases.[15222]","dateModified":"2019-01-25T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":7706,"questionText":"What are the symptoms of Mollaret meningitis?","answerText":"Mollaret meningitis is characterized by recurrent episodes of viral meningitis.
