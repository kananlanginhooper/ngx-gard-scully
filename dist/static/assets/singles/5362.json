The symptoms and severity depend on the size and location of the duplication, which genes are involved, and whether other chromosome abnormalities are also present. Some features only occur when a particular section of the chromosome is duplicated. Features that have been more commonly reported in people with a chromosome 8q duplication include developmental delay, learning difficulties, congenital heart defects, skeletal abnormalities, genital or urinary abnormalities, and distinctive facial features.[10135][15219] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost cases of chromosome 8q duplication are not inherited from a parent and occur by chance in people with no family history of chromosome abnormalities. In some cases, one parent has a rearrangement of chromosomal material, such as a balanced translocation or <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22042/\">inversion</a>, that increases the risk to have a child with a chromosome 8q duplication.[10135] Regardless of whether the duplication was inherited from a parent, a person with the duplication has an increased risk to have a child with a chromosome abnormality. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.","dateModified":"2019-01-24T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
