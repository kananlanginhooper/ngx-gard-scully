This page was created to provide a list of resources where you can find more information about reported adverse events of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, which is sometimes referred to as post-finasteride syndrome. Some patients who have taken finasteride have referred to  side effects such as sexual dysfunction and depression (sometimes severe). Limited information is available for patients and healthcare professionals on these side effects and whether or not they are permanent. Studies  are underway to better understand the effects of 5-alpha reductase inhibitor drugs.
