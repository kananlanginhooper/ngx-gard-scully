The most common neurological symptoms associated with HanDL syndrome include: weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis), a feeling of altered sensation down one side of the body (hemisensory disturbances), and a loss of the ability to understand or express speech (aphasia). These symptoms usually last between 15 minutes and 2 hours.[13423] The cause of HaNDL syndrome is not well understood; however, researchers have suggested a few potential causes, including migraines, inflammation of the tissue that lines the brain and spinal cord, and viral infections.[13423][13424] For some individuals, HaNDL syndrome may resolve without treatment, while for others, management of headache and neurological symptoms may be needed.[13422][13423]","dateModified":"2017-05-17T12:24:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":11850,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of HaNDL syndrome?","answerText":"The signs and symptoms of HaNDL syndrome include&nbsp;severe to moderate headache attacks, neurological symptoms, and an increase in the amount of a type of white blood cell in the cerebrospinal fluid (lymphocytic pleocytosis).[13422][13423]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeadaches associated with HaNDL syndrome may be limited to one side of the head or may involve both sides.
