Affected people develop episodes of red and tender skin with widespread pustules throughout their body. This is generally accompanied by fever, chills, headache, rapid pulse rate, loss of appetite, nausea and muscle weakness. The condition generally resolves within days or weeks; however, relapses are common.[9872] Some cases of generalized pustular psoriasis are caused by changes (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>) in the  <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IL36RN\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">IL36RN</a> gene and are inherited in an <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> manner.[9997] Possible triggers for <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/sporadic/\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">sporadic</a> forms of the condition include withdrawal from corticosteroids, exposure to certain medications, and/or infection; however, in many cases, the underlying cause is unknown. Generalized pustular psoriasis can be life threatening, so hospitalization and a specialist's care is usually required. Affected areas are treated with topical (on the skin) compresses with <a href=\"http://dermnetnz.org/treatments/emollients.html\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">emollients</a> and/or steroid creams.
