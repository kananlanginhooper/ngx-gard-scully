Most patients have difficulty articulating words. Common signs and symptoms include broad forehead, downslanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), short nose with broad tip, head appearing too large for the body, frontal hair upsweep, bulging digit pads and&nbsp;delayed gross motor skills. Some patients have autistic features and/or behavioral problems. Congenital malformations may be associated. All reported cases have been the first to occur in the family (de novo).
