It is typically characterized by hypotonia (low muscle tone) and seizures in the newborn period. Other symptoms include unusual facial features and an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly). Most babies with this condition never&nbsp;gain any&nbsp;developmental skills and do not survive past the age of 2. DBP deficiency is caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary.cfm?key=mutation\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HSD17B4\" target=\"_blank\">HSD17B4</a></em> gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>&nbsp;manner.[9420]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome researchers have suggested classifying DBP deficiency into three subtypes, depending on how severely the mutation in the <em>HSD17B4</em> gene affects the function of the gene and the protein that it codes for.

A fourth subtype has additionally been proposed for individuals that have less severe symptoms.[12714]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile there is no cure for DBP deficiency, treatment is focused on improving nutrition and growth, controlling symptoms, and limiting the progression of liver disease.[12715]","dateModified":"2016-12-06T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":2523,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of D-bifunctional protein (DBP) deficiency?","answerText":"The&nbsp;signs and symptoms of DBP deficiency are typically very severe, with almost all children presenting with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003298.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypotonia</a> (low muscle tone) and seizures in the first month of life.&nbsp;Other issues that might be present in children with DPB deficiency include:[1611][9420]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Eye problems (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003037.htm\" target=\"_blank\">nystagmus</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001004.htm\" target=\"_blank\">strabismus</a>, failure to focus on objects, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001622.htm\" target=\"_blank\">optic nerve atrophy</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cataract.html\" target=\"_blank\">cataracts</a>, and/or progressive vision loss)</li>\r\n    <li>Progressive hearing loss </li>\r\n    <li>Failure to achieve or loss of developmental milestones&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Distinct&nbsp;facial features (high forehead, high arched roof of the mouth (palate), enlarged soft spot (fontanelle), long <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/9012.htm\" target=\"_blank\">philtrum</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003030.htm\" target=\"_blank\">epicanthal folds</a>, widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003305.htm\" target=\"_blank\">macrocephaly</a>, <a href=\"https://elementsofmorphology.nih.gov/index.cgi?tid=588f04d3f1b40b25\" target=\"_blank\">retrognathia</a>, and low-set ears)</li>\r\n    <li>Enlarged liver (hepatomegaly)&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Brain abnormalities (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/polymicrogyria\" target=\"_blank\">polymicrogyria</a>, damage to the protective covering of the brain (demyelination))</li>\r\n</ul>","dateModified":"2016-12-06T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":1611,"authors":"Ferdinandusse S, Denis S, Mooyer PAW, Dekker C, Duran M, Sorrani-Lunsing RJ et al","articleTitle":"Clinical and Biochemical Spectrum of D-Bifunctional Protein Deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Ann Neurol","date":"2006","volume":"59(1)","pages":"92-104","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16278854","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9420,"authors":"","articleTitle":"D-bifunctional protein deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"April, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/d-bifunctional-protein-deficiency","dateAccessed":"2016-12-06T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":2526,"questionText":"What causes&nbsp;D-bifunctional protein (DBP) deficiency?","answerText":"DBP deficiency is caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>  in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HSD17B4\" target=\"_blank\">HSD17B4</a></em> gene. This gene codes for a special type of protein, called D-bifunctional protein, which is an enzyme (helps biochemical reactions take place). The D-bifunctional protein is found in structures within our cells called peroxisomes, which contain several different enzymes that break down different substances. The D-bifunctional protein is involved in breaking down products of fats in our diet called fatty acids. The protein has two separate parts with different enzyme activity, called hydratase and dehydrogenase domains. These domains help carry out the second and third steps of a metabolic process called the peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. This pathway breaks down fatty acid molecules so they can be transported out of the peroxisomes for reuse by the cell.[9420]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMutations in the <em>HSD17B4</em> gene that cause D-bifunctional protein deficiency can affect one or both of the protein's functions. Although this does not seem to affect the severity of the symptoms of the disorder, the condition may be grouped into three types based on which enzyme(s) is/are deficient:[9420][12714]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Type 1 - deficiency of both enzymes </li>\r\n    <li>Type 2 - deficiency of hydratase </li>\r\n    <li>Type 3 - deficiency of&nbsp;dehydrogenase</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nImpairment of one or both of the protein's functions prevents the ability of the protein from breaking down fatty acids properly, resulting in a buildup of fatty acids in the body. It is not clear how the fatty acid buildup leads to the symptoms of this disorder.[9420]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2016-12-06T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":9420,"authors":"","articleTitle":"D-bifunctional protein deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"April, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/d-bifunctional-protein-deficiency","dateAccessed":"2016-12-06T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12714,"authors":"McKusick, VA","articleTitle":"D-BIFUNCTIONAL PROTEIN DEFICIENCY","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"OMIM","date":"6/16/2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.omim.org/entry/261515","dateAccessed":"2016-12-06T00:00:00","authors2":"Kniffin, CL","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":2524,"questionText":"How is&nbsp;D-bifunctional protein (DBP) deficiency diagnosed?","answerText":"DBP deficiency can be diagnosed based on lab results showing increased levels of the following: (1) <a href=\"http://www.x-ald.nl/biochemistry-genetics/vlcfa/\" target=\"_blank\">very long-chain fatty acids</a>; (2) &alpha;-methyl-branched fatty acids such as pristanic acid and its precursor phytanic acid; and (3) Bile acid intermediates dihydroxycholestanoic acid (DHCA) and trihydroxycholestanoic acid (THCA).
