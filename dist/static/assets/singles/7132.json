People with MDS have abnormally low blood cell levels (low <a href=\"http://www.lls.org/#/diseaseinformation/managingyourcancer/newlydiagnosed/understandingdiagnosis/labimagingtests/bloodtests/bloodcounts/\" target=\"_blank\">blood counts</a>). Signs and&nbsp;symptoms may include dizziness, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, bruising and bleeding, frequent infections, and headaches.[5099][5100] In some people with MDS, the condition progresses to bone marrow failure&nbsp;or develops into&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/blood_disorders/leukemias/overview_of_leukemia.html?qt=acute leukemia&amp;alt=sh\" target=\"_blank\">acute leukemia</a>.[5099]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMDS develops when a cell with a mutation replicates, and the resulting copies begin to predominate in the bone marrow and suppress healthy stem cells. The mutation may result from a genetic predisposition, or from injury to the DNA caused by an exposure such as chemotherapy or radiation. In many people with MDS there is no obvious exposure or cause.[13710]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStandard treatments for people with MDS and decreased blood counts are constantly changing. The main components of care include  transfusions of the types of cells that are deficient and treatment of infections.[13710] A stem cell transplant may cure the disease, but it is only indicated in selected cases.[14775]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2018-07-06T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6069,"questionText":"What causes myelodysplastic syndromes?","answerText":"The development of MDS involves a series of genetic changes in a <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=693540\" target=\"_blank\">hematopoietic stem cell</a>. These changes alter normal cell growth and differentiation (development into different types of blood cells). This results in an accumulation of abnormal, immature cells in the bone marrow and the impaired creation of new blood cells.[13711] Genetic changes leading to the development of MDS may result from an inherited predisposition, or from damage to a cell's DNA ( a somatic mutation) caused by exposure to chemotherapy, radiation, viral infection, or certain&nbsp;chemicals (e.g., benzene). It is classified as \"secondary\" MDS when it is due to aggressive treatment&nbsp;of other cancers.
