Symptoms typically develop around puberty, after having normal adipose tissue in childhood.[14994] FPLD2 causes a loss of adipose tissue from the limbs, torso, buttocks and hips, while causing a buildup of adipose tissue in the face, neck, and upper back.[14994][11802][11803][11804] It may also cause increased musculature.[11802] Some people with FPLD2 have areas of dark, thick skin (<a href=\"https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/color-problems/acanthosis-nigricans\" target=\"_blank\">acanthosis nigricans</a>), and females may have excessive hairiness (<a href=\"https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/color-problems/acanthosis-nigricans\" target=\"_blank\">hirsutism</a>)&nbsp;and menstrual abnormalities.[14994] <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/metabolicdisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">Metabolic abnormalities</a>&nbsp;develop in adolescence or adulthood, leading to signs and symptoms that may include&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Diabetes/insulin-resistance-prediabetes/Pages/index.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">insulin resistance</a>, <a href=\"https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/hormonal-and-metabolic-disorders/cholesterol-disorders/dyslipidemia\" target=\"_blank\">dyslipidemia</a>, diabetes, <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/pancreatitis\" target=\"_blank\">pancreatitis</a> (or recurrent acute pancreatitis),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007657.htm\" target=\"_blank\">liver steatosis</a>, atherosclerosis, and an increased risk of heart disease.[11802][11803]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFPLD2 is caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>&nbsp;in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LMNA\" target=\"_blank\">LMNA</a></em> gene and inheritance is autosomal dominant.[11802][11803][11804] Treatment aims to correct metabolic abnormalities and manage complications.
