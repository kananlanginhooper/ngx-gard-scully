Mutations within this gene account for approximately 75% of all cases. The <em>MLC1</em> gene provides instructions for making a protein found primarily in astroglial cells in the brain. Astroglial cells are a specialized type of glial cell, which are cells that protect and maintain nerve cells. The role of the MLC1 protein is not fully understood; however, it is suspected to be involved in the control of fluids into cells or the strength of cells' attachment to one another.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nApproximately 20% of individuals with MLC have mutations in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HEPACAM\" target=\"_blank\">HEPACAM</a>&nbsp;</em>gene.
