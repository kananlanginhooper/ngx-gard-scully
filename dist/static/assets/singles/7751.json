In addition, BH4 deficiency leads to low levels of certain neurotransmitters, chemical messengers that control many body functions.  Symptoms can range from very mild to severe. Babies with BH4 deficiency appear normal at birth but may develop neurological symptoms such as abnormal muscle tone, poor head control, seizures, and delayed motor development. Without treatment, the condition can cause permanent intellectual disability. BH4 deficiency is caused by pathogenic variants in any one of several <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">genes</a> including the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/gch1/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>GCH1</em></a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/pcbd1/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>PCBD1</em></a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/pts/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>PTS</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/qdpr/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>QDPR</em></a> genes.
