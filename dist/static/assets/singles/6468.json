Other features include the gradual loss of strength and sensation in the arms and legs, muscle stiffness (spasticity), and impaired speech. Many individuals have a form of heart disease called <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000192.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</a>. Some develop diabetes, impaired vision, hearing loss, or an abnormal curvature of the spine (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/scoliosis.html\" target=\"_blank\">scoliosis</a>).&nbsp;Most people with Friedreich ataxia begin to experience the signs and symptoms around puberty. This condition is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FXN\" target=\"_blank\">FXN</a></em> gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> pattern.[4898]","dateModified":"2015-05-22T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":81,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Friedreich ataxia?","answerText":"Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 5 and 15 but can, on occasion, appear in adulthood or even as late as age 75. The first symptom is usually difficulty walking (gait ataxia). The ataxia gradually worsens and slowly spreads to the arms and then the trunk. Over time, muscles begin to weaken and waste away, especially in the feet, lower legs, and hands. Other symptoms include loss of tendon reflexes, especially in the knees and ankles. There is often a gradual loss of sensation in the extremities, which may spread to other parts of the body. Slurred speech (dysarthria), fatigue, and  involuntary eye movements  (nystagmus) are also common. Most people with Friedreich's ataxia develop scoliosis (a curving of the spine to one side), which, if severe, may impair breathing.[55]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Other symptoms that may occur include chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations. These symptoms are the result of various forms of heart disease that often accompany Friedreich ataxia, such as cardiomyopathy (enlargement of the heart), myocardial fibrosis (formation of fiber-like material in the muscles of the heart), and cardiac failure. Heart rhythm abnormalities such as tachycardia (fast heart rate) and heart block (impaired conduction of cardiac impulses within the heart) are also common. About 20 percent of people with Friedreich ataxia develop carbohydrate intolerance and 10 percent develop diabetes mellitus. Some people lose hearing or eyesight.[55]</span>\r\n<p>The rate of progression varies from person to person. Generally, within 10 to 20 years after the first symptoms appear, people with Friedreich ataxia need to consistently use a wheelchair. Life expectancy may be affected, and many people with Friedreich ataxia die in adulthood from the associated heart disease. However, some people with less severe symptoms of Friedreich ataxia live much longer, sometimes into their sixties or seventies[55].</p>","dateModified":"2015-05-22T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":55,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Friedreich's Ataxia Fact Sheet","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)","date":"April 16, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/friedreichs_ataxia/detail_friedreichs_ataxia.htm","dateAccessed":"2015-05-22T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":82,"questionText":"What causes Friedreich ataxia?","answerText":"Friedreich ataxia is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FXN\" target=\"_blank\">FXN</a></em> gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called frataxin.&nbsp;One region of the <em><span class=\"geneSymbol\">FXN</span> </em>gene contains a segment of DNA known as a GAA trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (one guanine and two adenines) that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, this segment is repeated 5 to 33 times within the <em><span class=\"geneSymbol\">FXN</span> </em>gene. In people with Friedreich ataxia, the GAA segment is repeated 66 to more than 1,000 times. The length of the GAA trinucleotide repeat appears to be related to the age at which the symptoms of Friedreich ataxia appear.[4898]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe abnormally long GAA trinucleotide repeat disrupts the production of frataxin, which severely reduces the amount of this protein in cells.
