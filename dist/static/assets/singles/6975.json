Connective tissue provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body such as bones, ligaments, muscles, walls of blood vessels, and heart valves. Marfan syndrome affects most organs and tissues, especially the skeleton, lungs, eyes, heart, and the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). It is caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>&nbsp;in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FBN1\" target=\"_blank\">FBN1</a></em> gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called fibrillin-1. Marfan syndrome is inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>&nbsp;pattern. At least 25% of cases are due to a new (<em>de novo</em>) mutation.[76][10605] Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms in each person.[10605]","dateModified":"2017-01-26T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":129,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of&nbsp;Marfan syndrome?","answerText":"The signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome vary widely in severity, timing of onset, and rate of progression. Affected individuals often are tall and lean, have elongated fingers and toes (arachnodactyly), and have an arm span that exceeds body height. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther common features of Marfan syndrome include:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Unusually flexible joints</li>\r\n    <li>Long and narrow face</li>\r\n    <li>Highly arched roof of the mouth </li>\r\n    <li>Crowded teeth</li>\r\n    <li>Scoliosis</li>\r\n    <li>Sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or a protruding chest (pectus carinatum)</li>\r\n    <li>Eye issues: About half of people with Marfan syndrome have a dislocated lens (ectopia lentis) in one or both eyes, and most have some degree of nearsightedness (myopia). Clouding of the lens (cataract) may occur in mid adulthood, and increased pressure within the eye (glaucoma) occurs more frequently than in people without Marfan syndrome. </li>\r\n    <li>Most people with Marfan syndrome have abnormalities of the heart and the aorta. Leaks in valves that control blood flow through the heart can cause shortness of breath, fatigue, and an irregular heartbeat felt as skipped or extra beats (palpitations). If leakage occurs, it usually affects the mitral valve, which is a valve between two chambers of the heart, or the aortic valve that regulates blood flow from the heart into the aorta. The first few inches of the aorta can weaken and stretch, which may lead to a bulge in the blood vessel wall (an aneurysm). The increased size of the aorta may cause the aortic valve to leak, which can lead to a sudden tearing of the layers in the aorta wall (aortic dissection). Aortic aneurysm and dissection can be life threatening.[28]</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Other signs and symptoms may include:[12973]</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Stretch marks in the skin</li>\r\n    <li>Abdominal or inguinal hernia, in which a bulge develops that contains part of the intestines</li>\r\n    <li>Lung problems (rarely).</li>\r\n</ul>","dateModified":"2017-01-26T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":28,"authors":"","articleTitle":"What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Marfan Syndrome?","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Heart Lung and Blood Institute","date":"2010","url":"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/mar/signs.html","dateAccessed":"2013-10-15T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":12973,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Questions and Answers about Marfan Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases","date":"October, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/marfan_syndrome/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":2609,"questionText":"How is Marfan syndrome inherited?","answerText":"Marfan syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
