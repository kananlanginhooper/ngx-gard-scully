Symptoms of BPES include a narrow eye opening (blepharophimosis), droopy eyelids (ptosis), an upward fold of the lower eyelid (epicanthus inversus), and an increased distance between the inner corners of the eyes (telecanthus). Because the eyelids cannot open fully, vision may be limited. There are two types of BPES. Type 1 includes the eye involvement and <span><a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/prematureovarianfailure.html\" target=\"_blank\">premature ovarian failure</a></span> (POF). In type 2, only the eyes are involved.

Autosomal means the gene is found on one of the numbered chromosomes found in both sexes. Dominant means that only one altered copy of a gene is necessary to have the condition. The variant can be inherited from either parent. Sometimes an autosomal dominant condition occurs because of a new genetic variant (de novo) and there is no history of this condition in the family.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nEach child of an individual with an autosomal dominant condition has a 50% or 1 in 2 chance of inheriting the variant and the condition. Typically, children who inherit a dominant variant will have the condition, but they may be more or less severely affected than their parent. Sometimes a person may have a gene variant for an autosomal dominant condition and show no signs or symptoms of the condition.
