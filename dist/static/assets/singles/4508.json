This hormone normally stimulates breast development and milk production in women. Prolactinoma can affect men or women. In women, the symptoms may include unusual milk production (galactorrhea) when not pregnant or nursing and having no menstrual cycles (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001218.htm\" target=\"_blank\">amenorrhea</a>). In men, the most common symptoms are decreased sex drive and infertility. Most prolactinomas occur by chance (sporadically) in people with no family history. In a small number of cases, prolactinoma may be caused by a genetic condition such as <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/3829/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10959/familial-isolated-pituitary-adenoma\" target=\"_blank\">familial isolated pituitary adenoma</a>. Treatment for prolactinoma usually involves taking oral&nbsp;medications known as dopamine agonists. These medications can reduce prolactin levels and shrink the tumor. In more severe cases, radiation therapy or surgery may be needed.[12290][12291]","dateModified":"2016-09-28T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[{"caseId":50827,"abbreviatedInquiry":"Is a prolactinoma a genetic condition?","caseQuestions":[{"questionId":8505,"questionText":"Is a prolactinoma a genetic condition?","answerText":"Most prolactinomas are thought to develop by chance without any known association to a genetic condition.[8601] &nbsp;However, up to 2.6% of individuals with a prolactinoma and no other symptoms may have a <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a> in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MEN1\" target=\"_blank\">MEN1</a> gene, which causes a genetic condition known as <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/3829/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)</a>. &nbsp;The chance of a prolactinoma being associated with MEN1 increases if the tumor is large or affects surrounding tissues (is <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=45741\" target=\"_blank\">invasive</a>), or if the individual develops multiple tumors, especially in other glands such as the <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/parathyroiddisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">parathyroids</a> or <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/17194.htm\" target=\"_blank\">pancreas</a>.[8601] &nbsp;Prolactinomas have also been associated with another, very rare genetic condition called <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK97965/\" target=\"_blank\">AIP-Related Familial Isolated Pituitary Adenomas</a>, caused by mutations in the AIP gene; only 50 families with this condition have been described in the medical literature.[8603][8615]<br />","dateModified":"2015-04-06T00:00:00","references":[{"referenceId":8601,"authors":"Trouillas J, Labat-Moleur F, Sturm N, Kujas M, Heymann MF, Figarella-Branger D, Patey M, Mazucca M, Decullier E, Vergès B, Chabre O, Calender A; Groupe d'études des Tumeurs Endocrines","articleTitle":"Pituitary tumors and hyperplasia in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome (MEN1): a case-control study in a series of 77 patients versus 2509 non-MEN1 patients","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"American Journal of Surgical Pathology","date":"2008","volume":"32(4)","pages":"534-543","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18300794","dateAccessed":"2015-04-05T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8602,"authors":"Brandi ML, Gagel RF, Angeli A, Bilezikian JP, Beck-Peccoz P, Bordi C, Conte-Devolx B, Falchetti A, Gheri RG, Libroia A, Lips CJ, Lombardi G, Mannelli M, Pacini F, Ponder BA, Raue F, Skogseid B, Tamburrano G, Thakker RV, Thompson NW, Tomassetti P, Tonelli F, Wells SA Jr, Marx SJ","articleTitle":"Guidelines for diagnosis and therapy of MEN type 1 and type 2","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism","date":"2001","volume":"86(12)","pages":"5658-5671","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11739416","dateAccessed":"2015-04-05T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8603,"authors":"Agarwal SK, Ozawa A, Mateo CM, Marx SJ","articleTitle":"The MEN1 gene and pituitary tumours","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Hormone Research","date":"2009","volume":"71(Suppl. 2)","pages":"131-138","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19407509","dateAccessed":"2015-04-05T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8615,"authors":"Korbonits M and Kumar AV","articleTitle":"AIP-Related Familial Isolated Pituitary Adenoma","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK97965/","dateAccessed":"2015-04-06T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}]}],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
