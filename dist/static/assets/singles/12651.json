Acanthamoeba species, are commonly found in lakes, swimming pools, tap water, and heating and air conditioning units. The disease affects immunocompromised peple and is very serious. Symptoms include mental status changes, loss of coordination, fever, muscular weakness or partial paralysis affecting one side of the body, double vision, sensitivity to light and other neurologic problems. The diagnosis is difficult and is often made at advanced stages. Tests useful in the diagnosis include brain scans, biopsies, or spinal taps and in disseminated disease, biopsy of the involved sites and testing by the laboratory experts. Early diagnosis is important for the prognosis. No single drug is effective; hence multiple antibiotics are needed for successful treatment. A combination of surgical and medical interventions involving multiple specialty experts is required to prevent death and morbidity in survivors.[9153][9154]","dateModified":"2015-06-24T09:44:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":9152,"authors":"Cennimo DJ","articleTitle":"Amebic Meningoencephalitis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"August 27, 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/996227-clinical","dateAccessed":"2015-06-23T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9155,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Acanthamoeba - Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis (GAE); Keratitis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","date":"October 22, 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/acanthamoeba/","dateAccessed":"2015-06-24T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12650,"relatedDiseaseName":"Amoebiasis due to free-living amoebae","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
