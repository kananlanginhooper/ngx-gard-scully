The classic infantile-onset starts before 12 month of age and involves the heart muscle (myocardiopathy). The later-onset form may start before 12 months of age (non-classic infantile-onset), or after 12 months of age, but does not affect the heart. Muscle weakness is a main symptom in all forms. The infantile-onset is the most severe form and, if untreated, it may lead to death from heart failure in the first year of life.
