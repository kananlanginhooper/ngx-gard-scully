This disorder presents with global developmental delay in childhood which becomes progressive in early adulthood. Symptoms include dystonia (a movement disorder resulting in muscular spasms, twisting and repetitive movements) spasticity, parkinsonism (slurred or slow speech, stiffness of the muscles, slow movement, and visible tremors), and cognitive decline.[12946][12951] BPAN is caused by mutations in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/WDR45\" target=\"_blank\"><em>WDR45</em></a> gene.[12945] &nbsp;It is inherited in a dominant X-linked manner.
