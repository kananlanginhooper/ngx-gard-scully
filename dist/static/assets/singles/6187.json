Ligneous conjunctivitis most often occurs on the inside of the eyelids, but may also affect the sclera, cornea and pupil, leading to vision loss.[5987]&nbsp;A systemic form of the condition may occur, affecting&nbsp;the mucous membranes of the larynx, vocal chords, nose, trachea, bronchi, vagina, cervix, and gingiva. The cause of&nbsp;ligneous conjunctivitis&nbsp;is unknown.&nbsp;Autosomal recessive inheritance has been suggested in some cases.[5988] Ligneous conjunctivitis is sometimes associated with a condition known as <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/congenital-plasminogen-deficiency\" target=_blank>congenital plasminogen deficiency</a>.","dateModified":"2013-04-29T12:46:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
