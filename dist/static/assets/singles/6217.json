At temperatures less than 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (normal body temperature), cryoglobulins become solid or gel-like and can block blood vessels. This causes a variety of health problems. Many people with cryoglobulins will not experience any symptoms. If symptoms occur, they may include skin ulcers, purple skin spots (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003232.htm\" target=\"_blank\">purpura</a>), numbness in the fingers and toes (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/raynaudsdisease.html\" target=\"_blank\">Raynaud's phenomenon</a>), joint pain, and kidney problems. The underlying cause is unknown. Simple cryoglobulinemia is typically associated with immune system cancers, such as multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is diagnosed based on the results of a clinical exam and the presence of cryoglobulins in the blood. Treatment varies based on the severity of symptoms and any underlying conditions.[15668][15669][15670][15671]","dateModified":"2020-06-16T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13531,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of simple cryoglobulinemia?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with simple cryoglobulinemia.
