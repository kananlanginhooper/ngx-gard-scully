Included in this spectrum are <a href=\"http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=en&amp;Expert=71505\" target=\"_blank\">cancer-associated retinopathy</a> (CAR), melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR) and presumed non-paraneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy (npAIR). Autoimmune retinopathy typically presents in the fifth and sixth decades with rapidly progressive, bilateral, painless visual deterioration. Examination of the fundus (the back inner part of the eye) is usually normal at presentation. [7266][7267] The underlying reason for the autoimmune attack on retinal cells remains unknown.
