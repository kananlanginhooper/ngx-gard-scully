In FIHP, tumors involving the parathyroid glands cause the production and release of excess <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003690.htm\" target=\"_blank\">parathyroid hormone</a>, which in turn causes increased calcium in the blood (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000365.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypercalcemia</a>). The tumors are usually benign, but a cancerous tumor can develop in rare cases. Abnormal levels of calcium cause many of the symptoms of FIHP, including kidney stones, nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure (hypertension), weakness, and fatigue. <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000360.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Osteoporosis</a> often also develops.

In some cases, the cause is unknown. Mutations in the <em>MEN1</em> and <em>CDC73</em> genes cause other conditions in which hyperparathyroidism is one of many features, but some people with mutations in these genes have only isolated hyperparathyroidism. FIHP can also represent an early stage of other syndromes.[8026] Treatment for FIHP often includes surgical removal of the affected gland(s).[8027]","dateModified":"2014-12-22T11:56:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":8067,"questionText":"How is familial isolated hyperparathyroidism inherited?","answerText":"Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHP) is typically inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner.[8026] This means that having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause signs or symptoms of the condition.

Whether PHP is familial may depend on a number of factors, including the presence of associated features or abnormalities; if other family members are diagnosed with PHP; and results of genetic testing. People with specific questions about whether they have PHP, or whether a familial form of PHP is present in their family, should speak with their healthcare provider or a genetics professional.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost cases of PHP are sporadic, which means it usually occurs in people with no family history of the condition. Hereditary forms of hyperparathyroidism are rare; about 10% of people with PHP have a hereditary condition. Hereditary conditions associated with PHP may include complex tumor syndromes such as <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/3829/men-1/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">MEN1</a>, <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/3830/men2/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">MEN2</a> or <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10829/hyperparathyroidism-jaw-tumor-syndrome/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome</a> (HPT-JT); or familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHP).[8030] Currently, the underlying cause of PHP can be identified in only a small number of affected people. Genetic testing may help to diagnose familial hyperparathyroid conditions, but in some cases, the gene responsible for the condition in an individual or family remains unknown.[8029]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven when a family is known to be affected by a hereditary hyperparathyroid disorder, distinguishing between FIHP and the other hereditary conditions can be hard. One reason is that some people who were first diagnosed with FIHP have later developed features of MEN1. The diagnosis of FIHP is largely made by excluding the presence of the other known genetic causes, because finding a mutation in a specific gene would change the diagnosis.","dateModified":"2014-12-22T15:55:00","references":[{"referenceId":8029,"authors":"Ghada El-Hajj Fuleihan and Andrew Arnold","articleTitle":"Pathogenesis and etiology of primary hyperparathyroidism","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"November, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"","dateAccessed":"2014-12-22T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"Waltham, MA","publisher":"UpToDate"},{"referenceId":8030,"authors":"Fadil M Hannan, M Andrew Nesbit, Paul T Christie, Carl Fratter, Nicholas E Dudley, Greg P Sadler and Rajesh V Thakker","articleTitle":"Familial isolated primary hyperparathyroidism caused by mutations of the MEN1 gene","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Nature Clinical Practice Endocrinology & Metabolism","date":"2008","volume":"4(1)","pages":"53-58","url":"http://www.nature.com/nrendo/journal/v4/n1/full/ncpendmet0718.html","dateAccessed":"2014-12-23T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":2567,"questionText":"How can I find a genetics professional in my area?","answerText":"To find a medical professional who specializes in genetics, you can ask your doctor for a referral or you can search for one yourself.
