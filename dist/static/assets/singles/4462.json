This can cause distinct facial features (Potter facies), which may include a flattened nose, recessed chin, skin folds covering the corners of the eyes (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003030.htm\">epicanthal folds</a>), and low-set abnormal ears. Having low amniotic fluid can also result in underdevelopment of the lungs (<a href=\"https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pulmonary-hypoplasia\">pulmonary hypoplasia</a>). Other associated features may include eye malformations and heart defects.[2892]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are various causes of Potter sequence including failure of the kidneys to develop (<a href=\"http://www.in.gov/isdh/files/renalagenesis.pdf\">bilateral renal agenesis</a>), <a href=\"http://www.urologyhealth.org/urologic-conditions/kidney-(renal)-dysplasia-and-cystic-disease?article=19\">polycystic kidney diseases</a>, <a href=\"http://prunebelly.org/#/what-is-pbs\">prune belly syndrome,</a> rupture of membranes surrounding the baby, and other kidney abnormalities. The underlying cause of the sequence is often undetermined, but it may be genetic in some cases. The inheritance pattern depends on the specific genetic cause.

After approximately 16 weeks of pregnancy, the amount of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002220.htm\">amniotic fluid</a> (fluid that surrounds the baby) depends on how much urine the developing baby is producing. In normal development, the baby continuously swallows amniotic fluid, which is then processed by the kidneys and excreted as urine. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBabies with Potter sequence have a problem with the kidneys or urinary tract that is preventing them from producing the correct amount of urine. This causes there to be a low amount of amniotic fluid (<a href=\"https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/oligohydramnios.aspx\">oligohydramnios</a>). When there is not enough amniotic fluid, the baby&rsquo;s lungs also become underdeveloped (<a href=\"https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pulmonary-hypoplasia\">pulmonary hypoplasia</a>). The low amount of amniotic fluid also causes the typical facial features seen in babies with Potter sequence (Potter facies) because there is not enough fluid to provide protection from the walls of the uterus.[2892][14090] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe exact cause of the low levels of amniotic fluid in babies with Potter sequence may vary.
