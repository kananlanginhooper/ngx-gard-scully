The most common signs and symptoms (features) of GPS include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003269.htm\" target=\"_blank\">abnormal genitals</a>&nbsp;(for boys, undescended testicles and underdeveloped scrotum; for girls, small labia and large clitoris), missing or underdeveloped kneecaps (patellae), stiff large joints with <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003173.htm\" target=\"_blank\">limited movement</a> (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003185.htm\" target=\"_blank\">contractures</a> of hips and knees or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001228.htm\" target=\"_blank\">clubfoot</a>), developmental delay, and intellectual disabilities. Other features may include missing the structure that connects the two sides of the brain (<a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Agenesis-Corpus-Callosum-Information-Page\" target=\"_blank\">agenesis of the corpus callosum</a>), swelling of the kidney due to build up of urine (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000474.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hydronephrosis</a>) and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000474.htm\" target=\"_blank\">congenital heart defect</a>s (the baby's heart did not form normally).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/thyroiddiseases.html\" target=\"_blank\">Thyroid problems</a> have been reported in some cases.[12901][12902]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGenitopatellar syndrome (GPS) is caused by changes or mutations in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/KAT6B\" target=\"_blank\">KAT6B</a></em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/KAT6B\" target=\"_blank\"> gene</a>..[12901][12902][12903] Diagnosis of GPS is usually suspected by the signs and symptoms (features) seen in the child. It is confirmed by genetic testing. There is no cure for GPS. Treatment focuses on the features present in each child and may include surgery (for example to correct heart defects or clubfoot), speech therapy, physical therapy (to increase range of motion of joints), and early childhood intervention and special education programs (for developmental delays and intellectual disability).[12903]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs of 2016, medical researchers are trying to decide if genitopatellar syndrome (GPS) is a separate syndrome from Say&ndash;Barber&ndash;Biesecker&ndash;Young&ndash;Simpson syndrome (SBBYSS). Both syndromes are caused by changes (mutations) in the same&nbsp;gene (<em>KAT6B</em>). The two syndromes also share a lot of the same features, and some children with mutations in <em>KAT6B</em> gene have a combination of features that fall in between the GPS and SBBYSS. This suggests that GPS and SBBYSS may be two ends of a spectrum of the same syndrome..[12901][12902]","dateModified":"2017-01-10T10:28:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
