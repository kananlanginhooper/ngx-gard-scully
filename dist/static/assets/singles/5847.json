The condition is progressive and over time the right ventricle&nbsp;loses the&nbsp;ability to pump blood.[5802] Individuals with ARVC often develop abnormal heart rhythms known as <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001101.htm\" target=\"_blank\">arrhythmias</a>, which can increase the risk of sudden cardiac arrest or death.&nbsp;Other symptoms of ARVC include chest palpitations, dizziness, fainting and shortness of breath. Often, sudden cardiac death can be the first sign of ARVC.&nbsp;ARVC is caused by genetic <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/basics/gene\" target=\"_blank\">genes</a> that instruct proteins to link one heart cell to the next.
