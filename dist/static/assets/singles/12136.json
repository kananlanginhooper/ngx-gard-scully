It is one of the many diseases that can cause the <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000490.htm\" target=\"_blank\">nephrotic syndrome</a>. C1q is a normal protein in the <a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/en/teens/immune.html\" target=\"_blank\">immune system</a>, and can be found floating in the circulation of most healthy people. In C1q nephropathy, however, this protein can also be found deposited throughout the kidneys.[10977] It has been thought to be a subgroup of <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000478.htm\" target=\"_blank\">primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis</a> or to be a combination of several disease groups rather than a single disease.[10978] As a disease, it is very similar to <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000496.htm\" target=\"_blank\">minimal change disease</a> (MCD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).[10977][10978] Criteria diagnosis includes C1q deposits on the kidney and no evidence of <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000435.htm\" target=\"_blank\">systemic lupus erythematosus</a>.[10978] Both children and adult patients may have no symptoms, except for the presence of blood or protein in the urine, or &nbsp;present with swelling of the feet and legs, high blood pressure and <a href=\"https://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/vascular/diseases/renal_insufficiency.html\" target=\"_blank\">kidney insufficiency</a>. The treatment of C1q nephropathy is the same as  for MCD or FSGS and includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/steroids.html\" target=\"_blank\">corticosteroids</a> and other immunosuppressive agents. Further research is needed to establish C1q nephropathy as a  recognized distinct clinical entity.[10979]","dateModified":"2016-03-18T19:10:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":9401,"authors":"Meyrier A & Appel GB","articleTitle":"Minimal change variants: Mesangial proliferation; IgM nephropathy; C1q nephropathy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"April 03, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimal-change-variants-mesangial-proliferation-igm-nephropathy-c1q-nephropathy","dateAccessed":"2015-07-27T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":9147,"relatedDiseaseName":"Minimal change disease","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
