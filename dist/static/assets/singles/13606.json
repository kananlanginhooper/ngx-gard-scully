Rarely, it has been associated with taking certain medications (drug-induced SPD).[14912] SPD may be treated with is oral <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682128.html\" target=\"_blank\">dapsone</a>, which often improves symptoms within one month. However, the pustules may return when treatment is stopped.[14912][14972] Other therapies have been tried with mixed results.[14912] While SPD may cause discomfort and cosmetic concerns, it typically does not affect overall health.[14971]","dateModified":"2018-09-17T10:38:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":12958,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of subcorneal pustular dermatosis?","answerText":"The main symptom of subcorneal pustular dermatosis (SPD) is an outbreak of round bumps on the skin that may resemble pus-filled pimples or blisters (pustules).[14911][14912] The pustules appear over a short period of time (hours), usually on healthy skin, but sometimes on skin that is irritated or inflamed.[14912][14972] Most commonly the outbreak appears in areas of the body where skin may touch or rub together through movement, including the groin area, under women's breasts, underarms, inside the elbows and behind the knees. Other areas of the trunk, the upper arms and upper legs may be affected. [14912][14971][14972] Pustules rarely form on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet, and the face is almost never affected.[14912][14972] The pustules initially appear separated from each other (isolated) or be grouped together in small clusters, but may spread and join together within one or two days, forming circular, ring-shaped (faded in the center), or wavy patterns on the skin.[14911][14912][14971][14973] The pustules have an unusual appearance because the pus tends to settle in the lower half of the blister leaving the upper half of the blister clear (known as hypopyon pustules).[14911][14912]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe pustules sometimes cause irritation, pain, or mild itching.[14912][14971] They break open easily and crust over before healing, sometimes leaving behind darkened spots on the skin (hyperpigmentation). The pustules typically do not cause scarring.[14912][14972] SPD usually affects the skin only, but some people may have generalized (systemic) symptoms such as a general feeling of being sick (malaise), fever, or joint pain.[14912] Additional symptoms may suggest other associated diseases or health problems may be present.
