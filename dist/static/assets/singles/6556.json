Symptoms such as nearsightedness (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001023.htm\" target=\"_blank\">myopia</a>), difficulty seeing in low light (night blindness), and loss of side (peripheral) vision develop during childhood.

These  vision changes may lead to blindness by about the age of 50. While most people with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina have no symptoms other than vision loss, neonatal hyperammonemia (excess ammonia in the blood in the newborn period), neurological abnormalities, intellectual disability, peripheral nerve problems, and muscle weakness may occur.
