It occurs mainly in people with a weakened <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/immunesystem.html\" target=\"_blank\">immune system</a>&nbsp;but can affect anyone, and about one-third of infected people do not have any immune problems.[3351][13263][13768]. This condition usually starts in the lungs and can spread to other body organs. Affected individuals usually experience problems with their lungs (chest pain, coughing up blood, fevers), brain (headaches and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003200.htm\" target=\"_blank\">seizures</a>), and skin (skin infections, ulcers, and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001353.htm\" target=\"_blank\">abscesses</a>).[3351] Nocardiosis is caused by a bacteria of the family (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8406/\" target=\"_blank\">genus)</a>&nbsp;known as Nocardia which have different species (types). Nocardia bacteria are able to cause localized or systemic  disease in humans and animals.[13768][13767][13262] The Nocordia bacteria are able to spread to any organ, specially the central nervous system (brain and spine), and have a tendency to recur or progress despite appropriate treatment.&nbsp;The nocardia bacteria are found in soil around the world. People contract this disease by either inhaling contaminated dust or if soil containing nocardia bacteria get into an open wound.[3351] People with nocardiosis may need to take multiple antibiotics given for several months&mdash;or even up to a year or more.[13263][13768]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2017-09-06T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":11740,"questionText":"How might nocardiosis be treated?","answerText":"Nocardiosis is typically treated with the use of antibiotics.&nbsp;Because some Nocardia species are resistant to certain antibiotics, laboratory testing is needed to find out which species is causing the infection and to which antibiotic these bacteria may be susceptible. Treatment usually lasts for at least six months and may involve use of more than one antibiotic, but depending on the severity may last for about a year.&nbsp;Some abscesses or wound infections may need to be surgically drained.[3351][13263][13262]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe antibiotic known as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) is considered the therapy of choice by most doctors.
