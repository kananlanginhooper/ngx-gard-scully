This is also called iron overload. Accumulation of iron in the organs is toxic and can cause organ damage. While many organs can be affected, iron overload is especially likely to affect the liver, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bloodheartandcirculation.html\">heart</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/8883.htm\">pancreas</a>.[1364] Hemochromatosis type 5 has only been reported in one family from Japan. People in this family who had the disease did not have any symptoms. However, an MRI showed increased levels of iron in the liver, heart, and bone marrow. There were also high levels of iron in the blood.[14368][14369] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHemochromatosis type 5 is caused by genetic changes (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\">mutations</a> or pathogenic variants) to the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FTH1\"><em>FTH1</em></a> <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/gene\">gene</a>.[14368] The disease is inherited in an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002049.htm\">autosomal dominant</a> manner. Because hemochromatosis type 5 is so rare, the disease may not be suspected until signs are seen on an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003335.htm\">MRI</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003895.htm\">liver biopsy</a>, or a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003488.htm\">blood test</a>. The diagnosis may be confirmed with <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/testing/genetictesting\">genetic testing</a>.[1364] Treatment for hemochromatosis type 5 may depend on the signs or symptoms in each person. Treatments that can be used to reduce iron levels in people with other types of hemochromatosis include removing blood (<a href=\"http://www.irondisorders.org/phlebotomy\">phlebotomy</a>) or <a href=\"http://www.irondisorders.org/chelation-therapy\">iron chelation</a>. These treatments can prevent additional organ damage but typically do not reverse existing damage.[1364] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo learn more about other types of hemochromatosis click on the disease names below:<br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10417/disease\">Hemochromatosis type 1</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Disease.aspx?diseaseID=10092\" target=\"_blank\">Hemochromatosis type 2</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10093/hemochromatosis-type-3\">Hemochromatosis type 3</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10094/hemochromatosis-type-4\">Hemochromatosis type 4</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Disease.aspx?diseaseID=7172\" target=\"_blank\">Neonatal hemochromatosis</a></li>\r\n</ul>","dateModified":"2018-02-18T17:12:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":12603,"questionText":"What causes hemochromatosis type 5?","answerText":"Hemochromatosis type 5 is caused by genetic changes (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\">mutations</a> or pathogenic variants) in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FTH1\"><em>FTH1</em></a> <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/gene\">gene</a>.[14368] This gene provides the body with instructions to make a protein called ferritin. Ferritin is a protein that is made of many parts (subunits), and its function is to help store iron in the body. When there are changes in the <em>FTH1</em> gene, ferritin does not store the appropriate amount of iron in the body. This causes iron to accumulate in different areas of the body, resulting in the signs of hemochromatosis type 5.[14370]&nbsp;<br />","dateModified":"2018-02-18T17:16:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":14368,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Hemochromatosis, Type 5; HFE5","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man","date":"November 6, 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://omim.org/entry/615517","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14370,"authors":"","articleTitle":"FTH1 ferritin heavy chain 1 [Homo sapiens (human)]","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Center for Biotechnology Information","date":"January 27, 2018","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2495","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":12604,"questionText":"How is hemochromatosis type 5 inherited?","answerText":"Hemochromatosis type 5 is inherited in an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002049.htm\">autosomal dominant</a> manner.[14368] This means that people with the disease have a genetic change (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\">mutation</a> or pathogenic variant) in one copy of the<em> </em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FTH1\"><em>FTH1</em></a><em> </em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/gene\">gene</a> in each cell of the body.
