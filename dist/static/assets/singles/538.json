This build up of promyelocytes leads to a shortage of normal white and red blood cells and platelets in the body. The signs and symptoms of APL include an increased risk to both bleed and form blood clots. Individuals may also experience excessive tiredness, pain in affected areas, loss of appetite, and weight loss.[1790][3668] APL usually occurs in middle-aged adults, but can be diagnosed at any age. It is caused by a mutation that is acquired over a person's lifetime, usually involving a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002330.htm\" target=\"_blank\">translocation</a> between <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/15\" target=\"_blank\">chromosomes 15</a> and <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/17\" target=\"_blank\">17</a>.[3668]  Treatment may include the use of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/common/popUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000367465&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English\" target=\"_blank\">all-trans retinoic acid</a> (ATRA) and <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/common/popUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046018&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English\" target=\"_blank\">arsenic trioxide</a>&nbsp;or anthracycline-based <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002324.htm\" target=\"_blank\">chemotherapy</a>.[12932][12933]","dateModified":"2017-01-18T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":5948,"questionText":"What causes acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)?","answerText":"APL is caused by a chromosomal <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=201\" target=\"_blank\">translocation</a> (rearrangement of material) that occurs in some of the body's cells during a person's lifetime (a <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=46586\" target=\"_blank\">somatic mutation</a>).
