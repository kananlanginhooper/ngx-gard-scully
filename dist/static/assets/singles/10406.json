Although scurvy is relatively rare in the United States, it continues to be a problem in malnourished populations around the world (such as impoverished, underdeveloped third world countries). Early features of the condition include general weakness, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003088.htm\" target=\"_blank\">fatigue</a> and aching limbs. If left untreated, more serious problems can develop such as <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000560.htm\" id=\"anch_24\" target=\"_blank\">anemia</a>, gum disease, and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003232.htm\" id=\"anch_25\" target=\"_blank\">skin hemorrhages</a>. Symptoms generally develop after at least 3 months of severe or total vitamin C deficiency. Scurvy can be cured with vitamin C supplements taken by mouth. Once recovery is complete, dietary modifications to ensure the  \"recommended daily intake\" of vitamin C is reached will prevent relapse. Except in the case of severe dental disease, permanent damage from scurvy does not usually occur.[9042][9043]","dateModified":"2016-11-14T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
