Lymphomas occur when cells of the immune system, known as B lymphocytes, grow and multiply uncontrollably. DLBCL occurs mostly in adults and is a fast-growing (aggressive) lymphoma. It can start in the lymph nodes or outside of the lymphatic system in the gastrointestinal tract, testes, thyroid, skin, breast, bone, or brain.[11772] Often, the first sign of DLBCL is a painless rapid swelling in the neck, armpit, abdomen, or groin caused by enlarged lymph nodes. For some people, the swelling may be painful. Other symptoms include night sweats, unexplained fevers, and weight loss.[11772][11774] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment may differ depending on the location of the tumor and the subtype of lymphoma.[11772][11773] For those who have advanced DCBCL and have not been treated previously, a combination of chemotherapy and the monoclonal antibody rituximab (Rituxan) (<a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/R-CHOP\" target=\"_blank\">R-CHOP</a>) may be tried.[11772][11774][11773]. In addition, as of October 2017, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/news/fullstory_169192.html\" target=\"_blank\">axicabtagene ciloleucel</a> (brand name: Yescarta), a type of gene therapy, has been approved by the United States FDA to treat  DCBCL that is not responding to at least two treatment attempts or has returned after being treated before.[14053] A stem cell transplant may also be an option if DLBCL returns or relapses.
