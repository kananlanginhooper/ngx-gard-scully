Symptoms typically begin in late childhood and include vomiting, dehydration, low blood pressure, especially upon standing (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007278.htm\" target=\"_blank\">orthostatic hypotension</a>), and low blood sugar levels (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000386.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypoglycemia</a>). Low blood pressure can also cause dizziness, blurred vision, and difficulty exercising. Other symptoms may include drooping eyelids (<a href=\"http://www.geteyesmart.org/eyesmart/diseases/ptosis.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">ptosis</a>), nasal congestion, muscle pain, and weakness.
