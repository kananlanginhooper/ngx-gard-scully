The term does not necessarily imply that the mutated gene must be inherited from an affected parent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn many people with an autosomal dominant condition, the disease-causing mutation occurs <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/sporadic/\" target=\"_blank\">sporadically</a> for the first time in the affected person.

However, once a person has a mutation, they then have a 50% chance to pass it on to each of their children. For some conditions (such as Sotos syndrome), only a very small proportion of people inherit the condition from a parent; most cases result from new mutations in the gene in people with no family history of the condition. If the child of a person with an autosomal dominant condition does not inherit the mutated gene, they cannot pass the mutated gene to their offspring.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome conditions greatly impair physical and/or intellectual abilities; others may shorten the lifespan so that affected people do not reach reproductive age.
