Voluntary muscles are the muscles that we directly control to make our body do things like walk, run, write, throw, lift, smile, and chew. In MG, the most commonly affected muscles are the muscles that control eye and eyelid movement, facial expressions, and swallowing. The degree of muscle weakness varies from person to person. People with more severe disease may have many muscles affected, including the muscles that control breathing. People with mild disease may have only one muscle group involved, such as the eye muscles.[640]<br />\n<br />\nIn general, signs and symptoms of MG may include:[640]<br />\n<ul>\n    <li>Drooping of one or both eyelids (ptosis)</li>\n    <li>Blurred or double vision (diplopia)</li>\n    <li>Unstable or waddling gait (manner of walking)</li>\n    <li>Weakness in the arms, hands, fingers, legs, and neck</li>\n    <li>Change in facial expression</li>\n    <li>Difficulty swallowing and shortness of breath</li>\n    <li>Impaired speech (dysarthria)</li>\n</ul>\nPeople can develop MG at any age.
