As a result, affected people may experience pain, speech impairment, and difficulty chewing and swallowing. It can interfere with nutrition, oral hygiene and the normal growth of the face and/or jaw. Although the condition can be diagnosed in people of all ages, it generally occurs during the first and second decades of life. Temporomandibular ankylosis is most commonly caused by trauma or infection; it may also be associated with certain conditions such as <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/9518/ankylosing-spondylitis/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">ankylosing spondylitis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000431.htm\" target=\"_blank\">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000434.htm\" target=\"_blank\">psoriasis</a>.
