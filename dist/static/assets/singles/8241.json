It is one of a group of related fat (lipid) disorders caused by certain changes in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/APOE\" target=\"_blank\">APOE</a></em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/APOE\" target=\"_blank\"> gene</a>. The genetic change associated with this condition is inherited in an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner though other factors, such as a patient's gender, the patient's lipid levels, and the genetic makeup of the other <em>APOE </em>gene may play a role in how the condition is expressed. There are currently no formal treatment guidelines. Management may involve the coordinated care of several different specialists including cardiologists, gastroenterologists, and hematologists. Patients with splenomegaly should be careful to avoid contact sports. Removal of the spleen (splenectomy) has been reported to make the condition worse.[12734]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSea-blue histiocytes can also be a secondary finding associated with a wide range of disorders, including <a href=\"http://www.mds-foundation.org/what-is-mds/\" target=\"_blank\">myelodysplastic syndromes</a>, lymphomas, chronic myelogenous leukemia, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/5194/idiopathic-thrombocytopenic-purpura\" target=\"_blank\">idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001207.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Niemann-Pick disease</a>, and <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/4011/norum-disease\" target=\"_blank\">Norum disease</a>.[12736][12737][12738] In these cases, treatment depends on the underlying disorder.<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2016-12-09T11:47:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
