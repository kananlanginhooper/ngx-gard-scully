In the United States, a rare disease is generally considered to be a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe condition most commonly develops between the ages of  45 and 60 years. It is 20 times more common in females who are postmenopausal, obese, or overweight. It may occur in women younger than age 45, but is almost never seen in children.[10564]","dateModified":"2016-10-20T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Statistics","references":[{"referenceId":10564,"authors":"Laura F McGevna","articleTitle":"Adiposis Dolorosa","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"February 6, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1082083-treatment","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[{"referenceId":7015,"authors":"Emma Hansson, Henry Svensson and Håkan Brorson","articleTitle":"Review of Dercum’s disease and proposal of diagnostic criteria, diagnostic methods, classification and management","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases","date":"April, 2012","volume":"7(23)","pages":"","url":"http://www.ojrd.com/content/7/1/23#B28","dateAccessed":"2013-11-12T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
