The lungs, kidneys, ovaries, and thyroid are the most commonly involved sites. Pleuropulmonary blastoma is the most commonly associated tumor and often occurs in infants and young children. Cysts in the kidneys (cystic nephroma) are also associated with DICER1 syndrome. These cysts typically develop in childhood, but do not usually cause any health problems. Women with DICER1 syndrome are at an increased risk for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001172.htm\">Sertoli-Leydig tumors</a> of the ovaries. DICER1 syndrome is also associated with goiter (multiple fluid-filled or solid tumors in the thyroid gland). These goiters typically occur in adulthood and most often do not cause symptoms. This syndrome is caused by mutations in the DICER1 gene. It is passed through families in an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\">autosomal dominant</a> fashion.[9540] Affected members in the same family can be very differently affected.[9540]<br />","dateModified":"2015-08-25T15:36:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[{"caseId":52821,"abbreviatedInquiry":"DICER1 syndrome runs in my husband's family.

In mice, it has been shown that the deletion of the DICER1 gene or inactivation of the Dicer protein affect sperm production, resulting in absent, decreased amounts, or abnormal sperm.[9536][9537][9538] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe did not find information in our search regarding an association between DICER1 gene mutations and molar pregnancy specifically. \"Partial\" molar pregnancies can be caused by fertilization by an abnormal sperm (one with two copies of chromosomes). It can also be caused by fertilization with two normal sperm. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"Complete\" molar pregnancies are thought to occur when the mother's chromosomes are lost and the father's chromosomes are duplicated.
