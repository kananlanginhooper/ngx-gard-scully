The most common signs and symptoms are&nbsp;severe  intellectual, speech and walking impairment. Infants with the disorder have low muscle tone, delayed mental and motor skills, and problems feeding. Many children with the disorder are non-verbal, although some use a few words. Walking is difficult for children with this rare disorder. Children who walk independently have an unsteady gait. Additional symptoms vary, but may include autistic features, behavior challenges, sleep disorder, seizures, hyper-flexible joints, involuntary movements, distinctive facial features, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001004.htm\">strabismus</a>.[14908][14909]","dateModified":"2018-09-12T14:53:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
