It depends on many factors, including the severity of the disorder, the person's ability to follow the strict diet recommendations, and the response to treatment. For example, some children appear to have more severe intellectual disability while others are more physically affected (e.g. severe <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003297.htm\" target=\"_blank\">spasticity</a>&nbsp;with <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003185.htm\" target=\"_blank\">joint contractures</a>). It is thought that approximately 75% of people with arginase deficiency live long lives.[5470]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf the disorder is not diagnosed or if a person with arginase deficiency is unable to follow the strict diet, the prognosis is poor and may include severe intellectual disability and muscle stiffness, loss of the ability to walk, and loss of bladder and bowel control.[5470] However, even with treatment, the outcome can vary. In some cases, treatment has been shown to significantly lower arginine levels in both the blood and the <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003428.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cerebrospinal fluid</a>, with some people even having near normal levels. With this response, continued treatment would be expected to improve long-term outlook and prevent progression of neurological symptoms. However,  some people with arginase deficiency who follow the recommended treatment regimen may continue to have high levels of arginine in their blood, which can be associated with symptoms that worsen over time.[11244] In fact, one older study found that  50% of  people with arginase deficiency who are compliant with treatment see an improvement in symptoms, 25% have symptoms that remain the same, and 25% experience a progression of the metabolic disorder.[11252]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span>Nonetheless, early diagnosis in the clinical course allows for improved outcome in most cases. Following</span>&nbsp;a low-protein diet is essential for a better prognosis.
