This may intensify with emotional stress, but progressively improves with age and usually disappears around 6 months of age.[3003][3007] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAbnormal eye movements are also common. Oculomotor apraxia occurs frequently and causes difficulty moving the eyes from side to side. People with oculomotor apraxia have to turn their heads to see things in their peripheral vision.[3007]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDevelopmental abilities, in particular language and motor skills, are delayed with variable severity. Mild to severe&nbsp;intellectual disability is common, but some people with Joubert syndrome have normal intellectual abilities.[3007] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDistinctive facial features are also characteristic. These include a broad forehead, arched eyebrows, droopy eyelids (ptosis), widely spaced eyes, low-set ears, and a triangular-shaped mouth.[3003]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJoubert syndrome can cause a wide range of additional signs and symptoms. The condition is sometimes associated with other eye abnormalities (such as retinal dystrophy, which can cause vision loss); kidney disease; liver disease; skeletal abnormalities (such as extra fingers and toes); and hormone (endocrine) problems.

There is a relatively high prevalence of Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD) in the French Canadian population, with several founder effects noted.[10649] A founder effect is the effect on a gene pool&nbsp;that occurs when a new population is formed (founded) by a small number of individuals from a larger population, with limited genetic variation. Founder effects are typically associated with an increase in the frequency of a specific autosomal recessive allele (version of a gene).[11868]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe family first described by Joubert et al in 1969 has been traced to a founder who immigrated to Quebec from France in the 1600s.
