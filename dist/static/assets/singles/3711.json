Therefore medical researchers believe deficiency of MBL is likely further influenced by other genetic and environmental factors that are currently poorly understood.[3409]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany of the published studies of the effects of MBL deficiency have conflicting findings, with one study finding a increase in risk or severity associated with MBL, while another finds no effect or even a decreased risk.[11420][3409][11423][11424] Several authors have suggested this is because those who are defined as having MBL deficiency differs markedly between the studies.[11423][11424]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall, however, there seems to be agreement that increased susceptibility to infection is generally seen in patients with MBL deficiency when additional factors that compromise the immune system are present.[11420][5226][3409][11423][11424]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince the MBL protein is involved in the inflammatory process, its deficiency has been studied in relation to autoimmune diseases.
