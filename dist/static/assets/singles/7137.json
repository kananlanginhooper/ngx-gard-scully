Some affected people have no noticeable symptoms of the condition. When present, signs and symptoms may include chest pain, abnormal heartbeat, shortness of breath, fatigue, signs of infection (i.e. fever, headache, sore throat, diarrhea), and leg swelling. Myocarditis can be caused by a variety of factors including infections (viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal), allergic reactions to certain medications, and exposure to certain chemicals. It can also be associated with other inflammatory conditions such as <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/lupus.html\" target=\"_blank\">lupus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hopkinsvasculitis.org/types-vasculitis/wegeners-granulomatosis/\" target=\"_blank\">Wegener's granulomatosis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/giantcellarteritis.html\" target=\"_blank\">giant cell arteritis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001250.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Takayasu's arteritis</a>.
