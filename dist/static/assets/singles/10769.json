Early symptoms include weakness in the feet and ankles, followed by weakness in the hands and wrists. Weakness in the feet&nbsp;leads to tightening of the <a href=\"https://www.foothealthfacts.org/conditions/achilles-tendon-disorders\" target=\"_blank\">Achilles tendon</a>, an inability to lift the big toe, and a high-stepping walk. Weakness in the&nbsp;hands makes it more difficult to lift the fingers, especially the&nbsp;third and fourth fingers.&nbsp;As the muscle weakness slowly progresses over the course of many years, other muscles of the body (e.g.,&nbsp;neck, face, legs, hips, and shoulders) weaken.[3219] Other findings include scoliosis and cardiomyopathy in up to one third of individuals.[14907] Most affected people remain mobile throughout life.[3219][14907] Life expectancy is normal.[3219] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLaing distal myopathy is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MYH7\" target=\"_blank\">MYH7</a>&nbsp;</em>gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> fashion.[3219][14907] Treatment may include physiotherapy to prevent tightening of the Achilles tendon and splinting of the ankle.
