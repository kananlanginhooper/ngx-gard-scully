It usually becomes apparent at birth or shortly after birth. The most common symptom is noisy breathing (stridor) that is often worse when the infant is on his/her back or crying. In more severe cases, symptoms may include difficulty breathing with the chest pulling inward (retraction), poor weight gain from difficulty feeding, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/sleepapnea.html\" target=\"_blank\">apnea</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003215.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cyanosis</a>. The underlying cause of the condition is unknown. Most cases occur sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. In 90% of affected infants, laryngomalacia will resolve on its own by the time an infant is 18 to 20 months old. However, severe cases may require immediate medical treatment such as medication or surgery.[5571][13557][14298]","dateModified":"2017-07-11T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":11995,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of l<span class=\"teaser\">aryngomalacia</span>?","answerText":"Signs and symptoms of laryngomalacia typically begin at or shortly after birth, with the average age at presentation approximately 2 weeks.&nbsp;The condition is primarily characterized by noisy breathing (stridor) that may be worse when the baby is agitated, feeding, crying or sleeping on his/her back.
