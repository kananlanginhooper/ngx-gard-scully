The most common type of heart defect associated with Eisenmenger syndrome is a &lsquo;hole in the heart&rsquo; or ventricular septal defect, but other types of heart defects can lead to Eisenmenger syndrome. The symptoms include blueish skin color (cyanosis), rounded fingers and toes (clubbing), and shortness of breath.[15208] The symptoms of ES typically get worse over time. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEisenmenger syndrome is not inherited in families. It is diagnosed based on the symptoms in a person with a heart defect that has not been repaired. Treatment for this syndrome includes medications for pulmonary hypertension and avoiding high-risk situations, such as pregnancy and high-altitudes.[15207]&nbsp; A heart-lung transplant is a treatment option for those who have severe ES.[15209]","dateModified":"2019-01-23T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":3725,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Eisenmenger syndrome?","answerText":"Signs and symptoms of Eisenmenger syndrome include:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>High blood pressure in the main blood vessels to the lungs (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryhypertension.html \" target=\"_blank\">pulmonary hypertension</a>)<br />\r\n&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Shortness of breath<br />\r\n&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Bluish skin, lips, finger and toes (cyanosis)<br />\r\n&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Rounded fingertips and toes (clubbing)<br />\r\n&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Chest pain&nbsp;<br />\r\n&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\t</span>Feeling tired or dizzy&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther signs and symptoms include an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), stroke, coughing up blood (hemoptysis), and swelling of joints from excess uric acid (gout).

These heart defects allow blood that has already picked up oxygen from the lungs to flow back into the lungs, instead of going out to the rest of the body. This can eventually lead to increased pressure in the pulmonary artery (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryhypertension.html\" target=\"_blank\">pulmonary hypertension</a>), the main blood vessel that connects the heart and the lungs. Increased pulmonary hypertension leads to abnormal blood flow and results in less oxygen going to the body.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver time, this abnormal&nbsp;blood flow can damage the small blood vessels in the lungs. This causes high blood pressure in the lungs. As a result, the blood backs up and does not go to the lungs to pick up oxygen.
