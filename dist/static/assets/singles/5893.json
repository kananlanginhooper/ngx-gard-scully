The disorder can cause polyhydramnios, which is an increased volume of fluid surrounding the fetus (amniotic fluid). Polyhydramnios increases the risk of premature birth.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeginning in infancy, affected individuals often fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). They lose excess amounts of salt (sodium chloride) in their urine, which leads to dehydration, constipation, and increased urine production (polyuria). In addition, large amounts of calcium are lost through the urine (hypercalciuria), which can cause weakening of the bones (osteopenia). Some of the calcium is deposited in the kidneys as they are concentrating urine, leading to hardening of the kidney tissue (nephrocalcinosis). Bartter syndrome is also characterized by low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia), which can result in muscle weakness, cramping, and fatigue. Rarely, affected children develop hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/images/PX000170_PRESENTATION.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">inner ear</a> (sensorineural deafness).\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo major forms of Bartter syndrome are distinguished by their age of onset and severity. One form begins before birth (antenatal) and is often life-threatening. The other form, often called the classical form, begins in early childhood and tends to be less severe. Once the genetic causes of Bartter syndrome were identified, researchers also split the disorder into different types based on the genes involved. Types I, II, and IV have the features of antenatal Bartter syndrome. Because type IV is also associated with hearing loss, it is sometimes called antenatal Bartter syndrome with sensorineural deafness. Type III usually has the features of classical Bartter syndrome.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/bartter-syndrome/\" target=\"_blank\">disease summary is from MedlinePlus Genetics</a>, an online health information resource from the National Institutes of Health.","dateModified":"2020-11-30T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":5612,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Bartter syndrome?","answerText":"The signs and symptoms associated with Bartter syndrome can vary depending on the form of Bartter syndrome an affected individual has.[4625] The antenatal forms (beginning before birth) can be life-threatening, while the classical form, beginning in early childhood, tends to be less severe.[4623]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe antenatal forms of Bartter syndrome (types I, II and IV)&nbsp;may first be characterized by abnormally high levels of amniotic fluid surrounding the affected fetus (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003267.htm\" target=\"_blank\">polyhydramnios</a>); premature delivery; and possibly life-threatening salt (sodium-chloride) loss.[4623][4626] Affected newborns may experience excessive urination (polyuria) and life-threatening episodes of fever and dehydration. Vomiting and diarrhea may also occur. Some affected infants have distinctive facial features (triangular face, prominent forehead, large eyes, protruding ears, and drooping mouth), failure to thrive, delayed growth, and/or <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001523.htm\" target=\"_blank\">intellectual disability</a>.[4625] Individuals with type IV may also have <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003291.htm\" target=\"_blank\">sensorineural deafness</a>&nbsp;(hearing loss caused by abnormalities in the inner ear).[4623]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClassical Bartter syndrome typically becomes apparent in childhood and is characterized by muscle weakness, cramping, spasms, and fatigue. Excessive thirst (polydipsia), excessive urination and the need to urinate at night (nocturia) may also be present. This can lead to dehydration. Some children crave salt. Additional symptoms include constipation, vomiting, elevated body temperature, growth delay and <a href=\"http://www.parentcenterhub.org/repository/ei-overview/#delay\" target=\"_blank\">developmental delay</a>.[4625]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome individuals with Bartter syndrome have significant electrolyte imbalances which can lead to irregular heartbeats (cardiac arrhythmias). This can increase the risk for sudden cardiac arrest. Another complication is excessive levels of calcium in the kidneys  (nephrocalcinosis). This can lead to blood in the urine, vomiting, and fever.
