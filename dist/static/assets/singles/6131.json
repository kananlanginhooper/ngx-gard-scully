Symptoms usually start in early adulthood. The most common symptom is a red, itchy rash that appears on the skin when it is exposed to the cold (e.g. cold weather or cold water). This reaction usually occurs within 5-10 minutes after exposure and can last for 1-2 hours. The exact cause of cold urticaria is unknown. In some cases, it may be associated with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/infectiousdiseases.html\" target=\"_blank\">infection</a>, insect bite, or blood cancer. It is diagnosed based on the symptoms and confirmed through tests that look for a specific reaction to cold. Treatment may consist of avoiding exposures that may trigger a reaction and medications that prevent allergic reactions like antihistamines.[9640][15549][15551][15552]","dateModified":"2020-05-11T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":9393,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of cold urticaria?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with cold urticaria.
