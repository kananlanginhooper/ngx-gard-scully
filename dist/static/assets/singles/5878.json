Many people who are infected with <a href=\"https://www.lymedisease.org/lyme-basics/co-infections/babesia/\" target=\"_blank\">Babesia</a> parasites do not experience any symptoms of the condition. When present, signs and symptoms may include flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, body aches, nausea and fatigue. In severe cases, babesiosis can be associated with <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000571.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hemolytic anemia</a>. Babesia parasites are primarily spread by infected ticks. Treatment is generally only required in people who develop symptoms of the condition.
