It is characterized by missing pieces of tissue in both the <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002291.htm\" target=\"_blank\">retina</a> (the light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye) and <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002318.htm\" target=\"_blank\">choroid</a> (the blood vessel layer under the retina). In many cases, retinochoroidal coloboma does not cause symptoms. However, complications such as <a href=\"https://nei.nih.gov/health/retinaldetach/retinaldetach\" target=\"_blank\">retinal detachment</a> may occur at any age. Other possible complications include loss of visual clarity or distorted vision; <a href=\"https://nei.nih.gov/health/cataract/cataract_facts\" target=\"_blank\">cataract</a>; and abnormal blood vessel growth in the choroid (choroidal neovascularization). Retinochoroidal coloboma can involve one or both eyes, and may occur alone or in association with other birth defects. It can be inherited or can occur <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/sporadic/\" target=\"_blank\">sporadically</a>.[5755][5756][5757]","dateModified":"2015-10-15T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":10956,"questionText":"How might retinochoroidal coloboma be treated?","answerText":"There is no cure for retinochoroidal coloboma. Treatment varies depending on the conditions or complications that present in each individual. In some instances, retinochoroidal colobomas do not cause any symptoms and treatment is not necessary. Complications that commonly occur include:[9809][5757]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Tear or detachment of the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002291.htm\" target=\"_blank\">retina</a> (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/retinaldetachment.html\" target=\"_blank\">retinal detachment</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Growth of new blood vessels  beneath the retina that disrupt vision (<a href=\"http://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/choroidal-neovascular-membranes\" target=\"_blank\">choroidal neovascularization</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Clouding of the lens (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cataract.html\" target=\"_blank\">cataracts</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Increased eye pressure leading to damage to the optic nerve (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/glaucoma.html\" target=\"_blank\">glaucoma</a>)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTreatment of retinal detachment depends on the severity of the condition. For smaller retina tears, laser surgery (photocoagulation) or freezing treatment (cryopexy) may be utilized to induce a scar that helps to secure the retina to the eye wall. For larger tears or a detachment, surgery is typically needed to place the retina back into its proper position. Options may include: scleral buckle, pneumatic retinopexy, or vitrectomy.[5757][12016] Surgical treatment of retinal detachment in individuals with retinochoroidal coloboma can be challenging and has variable success.[9809][5757]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment for choroidal neovascularization may include administration of medications that can block the abnormal growth of blood vessels (<a href=\"http://macula.org/anti-vegf-therapy\" target=\"_blank\">anti-VEGF treatment</a>), thermal laser treatment to destroy abnormal blood vessels, and <a href=\"http://www.amd.org/photodynamic-therapy-pdt/\" target=\"_blank\">photodynamic therapy</a> to damage unwanted blood vessels.[12017]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCataracts are usually treated surgically via a technique called phacoemulsification. In this procedure, an instrument is used to break up and remove the cloudy lens. A lens implant is then placed to allow light to pass through and focus properly on the retina.[12018]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGlaucoma treatment varies and may include medication or surgery. Various surgical techniques can be utilized including: laser trabeculoplasty, laser iridotomy, peripheral iridectomy, trabeculectomy, and aqueous shunt surgery. The goal of surgery in glaucoma is to reduce the pressure on the eye.[12019]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology provides information and videos on treatment for <a href=\"http://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/detached-torn-retina-treatment\" target=\"_blank\">retinal detachment</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/choroidal-neovascular-membranes-treatment\" target=\"_blank\">choroidal neovascularization</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/what-is-cataract-surgery\" target=\"_blank\">cataracts</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/glaucoma-treatment\" target=\"_blank\">glaucoma</a>.","dateModified":"2016-08-10T13:17:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":5757,"authors":"Barnard S, Shneor E, Brauner J, Millodot M, Gordon-Shaag A","articleTitle":"Bilateral chorioretinal coloboma discovered with ultra-wide field retinal imaging","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Optom","date":"2012","volume":"5(3)","pages":"150-154","url":"http://www.journalofoptometry.org/en/bilateral-chorioretinal-coloboma-discovered-with/articulo/90149576/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9809,"authors":"Venincasa VD","articleTitle":"Clinical and Echographic Features of Retinochoroidal and Optic Nerve Colobomas","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci","date":"June, 2015","volume":"56(6)","pages":"3615-3620","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=PMC4464105","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12016,"authors":"Kierstan Boyd","articleTitle":"Retinal Detachment: Torn or Detached Retina","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"American Academy of Ophthalmology","date":"March 1, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/detached-torn-retina-treatment","authors2":"Raj K Maturi","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12017,"authors":"Kierstan Boyd","articleTitle":"Choroidal Neovascular Membranes Treatment","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"American Academy of Ophthalmology","date":"October 14, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/choroidal-neovascular-membranes-treatment","authors2":"Robert H Janigian Jr","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12018,"authors":"Kierstan Boyd","articleTitle":"Cataract Surgery","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"American Academy of Ophthalmology","date":"March 1, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/what-is-cataract-surgery","authors2":"Elena M Jimenez","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12019,"authors":"Kierstan Boyd","articleTitle":"Glaucoma Treatment","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"American Academy of Ophthalmology","date":"Jan 10, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/glaucoma-treatment","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":9547,"questionText":"What is the long-term outlook for people with retinochoroidal coloboma?","answerText":"The visual outlook (prognosis) for people with colobomas varies greatly and depends on the severity and extent of involvement.
