In humans, the bacteria are often present in parts of the digestive tract where they do not generally cause problems. In the United States, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> and <em>Klebsiella oxytoca</em> are the two strains responsible for most human illnesses. Many <em>Klebsiella</em> infections are acquired in the hospital setting or in long-term care facilities. In fact, <em>Klebsiellae</em> account for up to 8% of all hospital-acquired infections. People with a compromised immune system and/or people who have an implanted medical device (such as a urinary catheter or airway tube) are more at risk for <em>Klebsiella</em> infections. Extensive use of antibiotics has resulted in the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of <em>Klebsiella</em>.
