However, there have been a few reports of the condition appearing to be familial. Furthermore, although the condition itself may not be inherited, some of the risk factors associated with Felty's syndrome may have genetic components. One study found that&nbsp;a family history of rheumatoid arthritis was more common in patients with Felty's syndrome and that there was a strong association with HLA-DR4 (an immune system gene common&nbsp;in individuals with RA). The authors also stated that there was an increased frequency of another gene as well, suggesting that certain other&nbsp;immune system genes may interact with HLA-DR4 and contribute to individuals developing Felty's syndrome.[2863]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn another report, the authors described&nbsp;a family in which 3 siblings had Felty's syndrome. All of the siblings shared&nbsp;a&nbsp;specific haplotype (a group of immune system genes that may be inherited together).
