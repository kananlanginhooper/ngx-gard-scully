Many people with papillary thyroid carcinoma have no signs or symptoms of the condition. When present, symptoms may include a small lump at the base of the neck, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, trouble breathing, and pain in the neck or throat. Although people of all ages may be diagnosed with&nbsp;the condition, women between ages 30 and 50 are most commonly affected. The cause of papillary thyroid carcinoma is currently unknown. Risks for developing thyroid cancer include a history of high-dose external radiation treatments to the neck and radiation exposure during nuclear plant disasters.
