Affected people may also have cachexia, dropped eyelids or weakness of other muscles of the eyes,   <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/peripheralneuropathy/detail_peripheralneuropathy.htm\" target=\"_blank\">peripheral neuropathy</a>&nbsp;(manifesting as tingling, numbness, and pain (paresthesias)  symmetric  weakness, that mainly affect the lower extremities) and hearing loss. Leukoencephalopathy, which is the deterioration of a type of brain tissue known as white matter, is a hallmark of MNGIE; however it does not usually cause symptoms in people with this disorder. MNGIE is caused by variations (mutations) in the <a class=\"link-dapple\" title=\"T Y M P\" href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene=tymp\" target=\"_blank\"><em>TYMP</em></a> gene, important for allowing adequate levels of thymidine in the mitochondria.&nbsp; Inheritance is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>.[1878][3190]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiagnosis is confirmed by detecting the&nbsp;<em>TYMP </em>gene variations or the increased levels of thymidine and deoxyuridine in blood.

Other treatment may include nutritional support,&nbsp; antibiotics for intestinal bacterial overgrowth, special education and and physical  therapy.[3190] It is recommended to avoid  medication that interfere with mitochondrial function, such as valproate, phenytoin, chloramphenicol, linezolid, aminoglycosides, and tetracycline.[14576]<br />","dateModified":"2018-04-25T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":4251,"questionText":"How might mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome be diagnosed?","answerText":"The clinical diagnosis of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE) is based on the presence of severe gastrointestinal dysmotility (when the muscles and nerves of the digestive system do not move food through the digestive tract efficiently), cachexia (wasting away of muscle and fat tissue), <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/ptosis\" target=_blank>ptosis</a>, external ophthalmoplegia (weakness in the muscles that control eye movement), <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000750.htm\" target=_blank>sensorimotor neuropathy</a>, asymptomatic <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/18144.htm\" target=_blank>leukoencephalopathy</a> (observed on brain MRI), and a family history consistent with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=_blank>autosomal recessive</a> inheritance.[3190]<br><br>Direct evidence of MNGIE syndrome can be provided by&nbsp;one of the following:&nbsp;<br>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A blood test showing an increase in plasma thymidine concentration (greater than 3 &#181;mol/L) and an increase in plasma deoxyuridine concentration (greater than 5 &#181;mol/L).
