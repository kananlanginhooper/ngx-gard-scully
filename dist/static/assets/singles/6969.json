In MCL, there are  cancerous B-cells (a type of immune system cell). The cancerous B-cells are within a region of the lymph node known as the mantle zone.[3949] Although MCLs are slow-growing cancers, the cancer is usually widespread by the time it is diagnosed. In these situations, treatment must be intensive since MCL can become life threatening within a short period of time.[3947][3948] MCL accounts for 6% of all NHL's and is mostly found in males during their early 60s.[3946][3947][3948]","dateModified":"2016-04-27T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":4955,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Mantle cell lymphoma?","answerText":"Signs and symptoms of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) may include swelling of the lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue.
