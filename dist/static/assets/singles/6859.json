This gene encodes growth hormone receptor, which is a protein found on the outer membrane of cells throughout the body. Growth hormone receptor is designed to recognize and bind growth hormone, which&nbsp;triggers cellular growth and division. When growth hormone is bound to the growth hormone receptors on liver cells, specifically, insulin-like growth factor I (another important growth-promoting hormone) is produced. Mutations in <em>GHR</em> impair the function of growth hormone receptors which interferes with their ability to bind growth hormone. This disrupts normal growth and development of cells and prevents the production of insulin-like growth factor I which causes the many signs and symptoms of Laron&nbsp;syndrome.[9719]","dateModified":"2015-09-29T21:05:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":9719,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Laron syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"April 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/laron-syndrome","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":9484,"questionText":"Is Laron syndrome inherited?","answerText":"Most cases of Laron syndrome are inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>  manner.[9719] This means that to be affected, a person must have a <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a> in both copies of the responsible <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a> in each cell.
