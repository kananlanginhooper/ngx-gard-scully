Other signs and symptoms may include cataplexy (a sudden loss of muscle tone that makes a person go limp or unable to move); vivid dream-like images or hallucinations; and/or total paralysis just before falling asleep or after waking-up. Narcolepsy may have several causes, the most common being low levels of the neurotransmitter hypocretin (for various possible reasons).

Cataplexy is a sudden loss of muscle tone and control while a person is awake. Cataplectic attacks vary in length of time and severity. They may be barely perceptible (such as a momentary sense of slight weakness), or severe, resulting in a complete loss of tone in all voluntary muscles. This can lead to collapse, during which an affected person is unable to move, speak, or keep the eyes open. However, even during the most severe episodes, people remain fully conscious - this characteristic is what distinguishes cataplexy from seizure disorders.[3117] Additionally, some people with narcolepsy have so-called microsleep episodes, in which they behave automatically without conscious awareness. During these episodes, a person's behavior may resemble some forms of epileptic seizures.[8767] Narcolepsy can easily be mistaken for epilepsy, so ruling out epilepsy is an important part of making a diagnosis of narcolepsy.[8767]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeizures may be a very serious side effect of the drug <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a605032.html\" target=\"_blank\">sodium oxybate</a>, one of the main drug treatments for narcolepsy.

People often seek medical help for single symptoms that could be associated with other disorders, particularly <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003200.htm\" target=\"_blank\">epilepsy</a>.&nbsp;In come cases, symptoms are not dramatically apparent for years.[8767]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSleep studies are an essential part of the evaluation of people with possible narcolepsy. The combination of an overnight <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003932.htm\" target=\"_blank\">polysomnogram</a> (PSG) followed by a <a href=\"http://www.sleepeducation.com/disease-detection/multiple-sleep-latency-test/overview-and-facts\" target=\"_blank\">multiple sleep latency test</a> (MSLT) can provide strongly suggestive evidence of narcolepsy, while excluding other sleep disorders. Measurement of hypocretin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may further help to establish the diagnosis.[8763] People with narcolepsy often have extremely low levels of hypocretin in their CSF.[8764] In some cases, <a href=\"http://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/hla-testing/tab/test/\" target=\"_blank\">human leukocyte antigen</a> (HLA) typing may be helpful.[3117]","dateModified":"2015-04-27T09:59:00","resourceClassificationName":"Diagnosis","references":[{"referenceId":3117,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Narcolepsy Fact Sheet","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke","date":"January 5, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/narcolepsy/detail_narcolepsy.htm","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8763,"authors":"Ali M Bozorg","articleTitle":"Narcolepsy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape","date":"April 15, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1188433-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8764,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Narcolepsy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"NORD","date":"March 2, 2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.rarediseases.org/rare-disease-information/rare-diseases/byID/55/viewAbstract","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8767,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Narcolepsy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"University of Maryland Medical Center","date":"September 18, 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://umm.edu/health/medical/reports/articles/narcolepsy","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}]}],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
