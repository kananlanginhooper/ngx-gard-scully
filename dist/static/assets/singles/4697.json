People with PBC may have symptoms such as tiredness (fatigue) and itchy skin (pruritus), as well as an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly). Signs and symptoms of LCSS may include calcium deposits in the skin, tissues, and organs (calcinosis); sores on the fingers and toes (<span><a href=\"https://www.sruk.co.uk/scleroderma/digital-ulcers/\">digital ulcers</a></span>); facial <span><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003284.htm\">telangiectasias</a></span>; <span><a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/raynauds\">Raynaud's phenomenon</a></span>; esophageal dysfunction (such as acid reflux); and <span><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/19508.htm\">sclerodactyly</a></span> (tightening of the skin on the fingers and toes).[15346] Reynolds syndrome typically occurs sporadically, affecting only one person in a family.[15346] Treatment aims to improve the signs and symptoms associated with each disease individually and may involve ursodeoxycholic acid for PBC to slow the progression of liver disease and various medications for the wide variety of possible symptoms of LCSS.[15346]<strong><br />\r\n</strong>","dateModified":"2019-04-02T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
