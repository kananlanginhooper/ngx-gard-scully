In addition, people with RMS have excess blood insulin levels and irregular sugar (glucose) levels. Some people with RMS have developmental and intellectual disabilities.[15148][2704] Over time, people with RMS can have organ damage due to unregulated blood sugar. This disorder is diagnosed based on the signs and symptoms, laboratory testing, and genetic testing of the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/INSR\" target=\"_blank\">INSR</a></em> gene.[15148][15149]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRMS is caused by a mutation in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/INSR\" target=\"_blank\">INSR</a></em> gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[15148][15149] Treatment is difficult and may include high doses of insulin and/or recombinant insulin-like growth factor.[15148] [151491]The long-term outlook for people with RMS is variable. Unregulated sugar levels over a long period of time can lead to a shortened lifespan.[15148]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDonohue syndrome (leprechaunism) is a more severe form of <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/INSR\" target=\"_blank\">INSR</a></em>-related syndromic insulin resistance. Symptoms are similar to those seen in RMS, but are more serious.&nbsp; Most children with Donohue syndrome die before one year of age. Type A insulin resistance syndrome (type A) is a milder form of <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/INSR\" target=\"_blank\">INSR</a></em>-related syndromic insulin resistance. People with type A are often not diagnosed until their teens.[15148]<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2019-01-04T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":2704,"authors":"Cochran E","articleTitle":"Rabson-Mendenhall Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)","date":"2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.rarediseases.org/search/rdbdetail_abstract.html?disname=Rabson-Mendenhall%20Syndrome","dateAccessed":"2010-11-09T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15148,"authors":"Ben Harouch S, Klar A, Falik Zaccai TC","articleTitle":"INSR-related severe syndromic insulin resistance","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"2018","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK476444","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15149,"authors":"Sinnarajah K, Dayasiri MB, Dissanayake ND, Kudagammana ST, Jayaweera AH.","articleTitle":"Rabson Mendenhall Syndrome caused by a novel missense mutation","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Int J Pediatr Endo","date":"2016","volume":"2016(21)","pages":"1-5","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27891155","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12377,"relatedDiseaseName":"Hypertrichosis ","relation":"Parent","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":6885,"relatedDiseaseName":"Leprechaunism","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
