Symptoms include burning pain (often unilateral), tingling, or numbness in any of the following areas: buttocks, genitals, or perineum (area between the buttocks and genitals). Symptoms are typically present when a person is sitting but often go away when the person is standing or lying down. The pain tends to increase as the day progresses. Additional symptoms include pain during sex and needing to urinate frequently and/or urgently. Damage to the pudendal nerve can result from surgical procedures, childbirth, trauma, spasms of the pelvic floor muscles, or tumors. Pudendal neuralgia may also result from certain infections (such as herpes simplex infections) or certain activities (such as cycling and squatting exercises). There are no imaging studies that diagnose pudendal neuralgia; however, MRI and CT may help to exclude other causes of the pain. Physical therapy is often the first line of treatment.[12925][12926]&nbsp;<br />","dateModified":"2017-01-17T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6585,"questionText":"What treatments are available for pudendal neuralgia?","answerText":"Many physicians suggest using a step-ladder approach to therapy for individuals with pudendal neuralgia.
