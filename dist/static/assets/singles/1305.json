Signs and symptoms in infants may include low\r\nmuscle tone, involuntary movements (chorea), lung infections, and\r\nrespiratory distress. Signs and symptoms in children may include delayed\r\nmotor and walking milestones, jerky muscle movements (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/myoclonus/detail_myoclonus.htm\">myoclonus</a>), upper limb <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/dystonia.html\">dystonia</a>,\r\nmotor tics, and vocal tics.[7578] The chorea often improves with time. In\r\nsome cases, myoclonus persists or worsens. Children with BHC can have\r\nnormal intellect, but may have learning and behavior problems. Other\r\nsigns and symptoms include thyroid problems (e.g., <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000353.htm\">hypothyroidism</a>)\r\nand lung disease (e.g., recurring infections).[7578] Treatment is tailored\r\nto each child. Tetrabenazine and levodopa have been tried in individual\r\ncases with some success.[7578] BHC is caused by mutations in the NKX2-1 gene\r\n(also known as the TITF1 gene). It is passed through families in an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\">autosomal dominant</a> fashion.[7578]","dateModified":"2014-08-07T14:06:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
