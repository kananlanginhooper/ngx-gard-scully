Typically, people affected by brachydactyly type A2 have very short (hypoplastic) middle bones of these digits. In some individuals, the bone above the middle phalanx (distal phalanx) is shifted as well, so that the fingers and toes may look misshapen. There have not been reports of other symptoms associated with brachydactyly type A2. Typically, brachydactyly type A2 does not require surgery, and affected individuals are able to use their hands normally.[12475][12476]<br />","dateModified":"2016-10-31T09:31:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":11240,"questionText":"How is brachydactyly type A2 inherited?","answerText":"Brachydactyly type A2 is a genetic condition, meaning that it is caused by a change (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a>) in a person&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">genes</a>.
