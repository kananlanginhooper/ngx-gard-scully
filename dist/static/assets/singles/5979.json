Attacks most often affect 3 parts of the body:[14821][14822]\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Skin - the most common sites are the face (such as the lips and eyes), hands, arms, legs, genitals, and buttocks. Skin swelling can cause pain, dysfunction, and disfigurement, although it is generally not dangerous and is temporary.</li>\r\n    <li>Gastrointestinal tract - the stomach, intestines, bladder, and/or urethra may be involved. This may cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.</li>\r\n    <li>Upper airway (such as the larynx and tongue) - this can cause upper airway obstruction and may be life-threatening. The majority of attacks affecting the airway resolve before complete airway obstruction.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Attacks may involve one area of the body at a time, or they may involve a combination of areas. They always go away on their own but last from 2 to 4 days. While people with HAE have reported various triggers of attacks, emotional stress, physical stress, and dental procedures are the most commonly reported triggers.[14821]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are several types of HAE.[14820]&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Types I and II are caused by mutations in the</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</span><em style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">C1NH</em><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">gene (also called the</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</span><em style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SERPING1\" target=\"_blank\">SERPING1</a></em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SERPING1\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SERPING1\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a>), which provides instructions for making the C1 inhibitor protein.[14820][14822]&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Type I is due to deficiency of C1 inhibitor, and type II is due to dysfunction of C1 inhibitor.[14820] These types are also characterized by abnormal </span><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003456.htm\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">complement protein levels</a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">.</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Inheritance of types I and II is autosomal dominant, but not all people with a <em>SERPING1</em> gene mutation will develop symptoms of HAE. A third type is called&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">HAE with normal C1 inhibitor. This type is characterized by normal C1 inhibitor and normal complement protein levels, and usually begins in adulthood.[14823] While some cases of type III are due to mutations in the </span><em style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/F12\" target=\"_blank\">F12</a></em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/F12\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> gene</a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">, in other cases the cause is not yet known.[14820][2938] The inheritance of this form is also thought to be autosomal dominant.[14823]</span></p>\r\n<p>Management of HAE involves treatment of sudden (acute) attacks and preventing attacks (prophylaxis).[14822] Treatment for acute attacks in types I and II includes&nbsp;replacement with C1 inhibitor concentrates, a <a href=\"https://reference.medscape.com/drugs/kallikrein-inhibitors\" target=\"_blank\">kallikrein inhibitor</a>, or fresh-frozen plasma (by infusion).[14822]&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Sudden attacks involving the upper airway may involve <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003449.htm\" target=\"_blank\">intubation</a> if stridor or signs of respiratory distress are present.[14823]</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">HAE with normal C1 inhibitor levels is treated similarly, however C1 inhibitor infusion is not effective.
