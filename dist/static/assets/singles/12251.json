In individuals with IEL, the lens in one or both of the eyes is off-center. Symptoms of IOL usually present in childhood and may include vision problems such as nearsightedness (<a href=\"https://nei.nih.gov/health/errors/myopia\" target=\"_blank\">myopia</a>), blurred vision (<a href=\"https://nei.nih.gov/health/errors/astigmatism\" target=\"_blank\">astigmatism</a>), clouding of the lenses (<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/cataract.html\" target=\"_blank\">cataracts</a>), and increased pressure in the eyes (<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/glaucoma.html\" target=\"_blank\">glaucoma</a>). In some individuals, IEL can progress to <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/retinaldetachment.html\" target=\"_blank\">retinal detachmen</a>t (tearing of the back lining of the eye).
