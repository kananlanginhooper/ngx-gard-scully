A combination of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/surgery/about/innovations/hipec.html\" target=\"_blank\">cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy</a> is often the most successful treatment, and can achieve overall survival outcomes of up to 84% at 5 years.[11200][11199][12842] Cytoreductive surgery involves removing all lesions that can be removed.
