It is caused by destruction of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002344.htm\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">white matter</a>&nbsp;of the brain. The white matter degrades due to defects of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002261.htm\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">myelin</a>, which is a fatty covering that insulates nerves in the brain. Myelin is needed to protect the nerves and the nerves can't function normally without it. These disorders are progressive, meaning they tend to get worse with time.
