A timely diagnosis and treatment of developing eye problems is very important to increase the chance that vision loss can be minimized. Corrective glasses, visual aids, or&nbsp;eye surgery may be needed to improve vision. Removal of the microspherophakia is recommended to control intraocular pressure and improve vision.&nbsp;Increased pressure within the eye (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/glaucoma.html\" target=\"_blank\">glaucoma</a>) may be treated with eye drops, laser therapy, surgical removal of the iris or lens. Contraction or dilation of the pupils can cause glaucoma in some people with Weill-Marchesani syndrome. Medications that contract the pupil&nbsp;must be avoided, and medications that dilate the pupils must be given&nbsp;with care.[507][13865]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJoint stiffness and bone abnormalities can cause complications if anesthesia is needed. A person with Weill-Marchesani syndrome needs to tell their doctor, surgeon, and anesthesiologist of the diagnosis before receiving anesthesia, as the syndrome can impact airway management.[507]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRecommended evaluations when a child is first diagnosed with Weill-Marchesani syndrome include:[508]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Complete eye exam by an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.aao.org/about/eyemds.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">ophthalmologist</a></li>\r\n    <li>Evaluation by a medical genetics specialist</li>\r\n    <li>Cardiac echocardiogram</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2017-09-30T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":507,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Weill-Marchesani Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)","date":"2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/weill-marchesani-syndrome/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":508,"authors":"Tsilou E & MacDonald I","articleTitle":"Weill-Marchesani Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1114/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13866,"authors":"Guo H,  Wu X,  Cai K &i Qiao Z","articleTitle":"Weill-Marchesani syndrome with advanced glaucoma and corneal endothelial dysfunction: a case report and literature review","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"BMC Ophthalmology","date":"2015","volume":"15","pages":"3","url":"https://bmcophthalmol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2415-15-3","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}]}],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
