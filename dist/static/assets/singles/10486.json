Craniopharyngiomas are thought to arise from epithelial remnants of the craniopharyngeal duct or Rathke's pouch, (an outpouch of the primitive oral cavity that forms the anterior part of the pituitary gland). Embryonic cells (early fetal cells) from abnormal development of the craniopharyngeal duct or anterior <a href=\"http://training.seer.cancer.gov/brain/tumors/anatomy/glands.html\" target=\"_blank\">pituitary gland</a> may give rise to a craniopharyngioma. These tumors are closely related to another cystic mass occasionally seen in the pituitary called <a href=\"http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/adult/nervous_system_disorders/rathke_cleft_cysts_134,86/\" target=\"_blank\">Rathkes cleft cyst</a>.[1091][1092][11994]","dateModified":"2017-03-31T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":1091,"authors":"Garnett MR, Puget S, Grill J & Sainte-Rose C","articleTitle":"Craniopharyngioma","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet","date":"2007","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=EN&Expert=54595","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":1092,"authors":"George C Bobustuc, George I Jallo, Franco DeMonte, Gregory N Fuller, Morris D Groves, Lee S Hwang","articleTitle":"Craniopharyngioma","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape","date":"Oct 27, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1157758","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11994,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Craniopharyngioma","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Pituitary Network Association","date":"2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://pituitary.org/knowledge-base/disorders/craniopharyngioma","dateAccessed":"2016-08-05T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":1803,"questionText":"How might craniopharyngiomas be treated?","answerText":"Treatment for craniopharyngiomas has been controversial. Two main management options have primarily been used: attempt at complete removal (gross total resection), or partial removal (partial resection) followed by radiation therapy to treat residual disease.[13286] Advances in techniques used in neurosurgery have made total resection possible in more cases, but improvements in radiation therapy techniques have also made this option more effective and safe. There currently is no firm consensus of opinion regarding the best treatment option.[13286] Unfortunately, even following treatment, many people experience endocrine, vascular, neurologic, and/or visual complications. Psychological, social, and emotional problems are also common.[13286][14842] <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/panhypopituitarism\" target=\"_blank\">Panhypopituitarism</a> (when the pituitary gland does not make most or all hormones) and hypothalamic dysfunction are prevalent and are treated with hormone therapy to replace various pituitary and hypothalamic hormone deficiencies.[14843] Early studies suggest that <a href=\"http://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/oxytocin/\" target=\"_blank\">oxytocin</a>&nbsp;(a less understood hormone often not replaced) may benefit some people with certain symptoms of hypothalamic dysfunction such as obesity and behavioral issues; however, additional research on larger groups of people is needed to determine its role in therapy.[14842][14843][14844]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn experienced multidisciplinary team of  specialists (<a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/common/popUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046269&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English\" target=\"_blank\">neurosurgeon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/common/popUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046546&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English\" target=\"_blank\">radiation oncologist</a>, neuro-oncologist, endocrinologist,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/common/popUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000631048&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English\" target=\"_blank\">ophthalmologist</a>) is essential for the best treatment of both pediatric and adult patients with craniopharyngiomas.[13286]","dateModified":"2018-07-31T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":1090,"authors":"","articleTitle":"General Information About Childhood Craniopharyngioma","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Cancer Institute (NCI)","date":"June 10, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.cancer.gov/types/brain/patient/child-cranio-treatment-pdq","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13286,"authors":"Harsh GR, Recht LD & Marcus KJ","articleTitle":"Craniopharyngioma","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"October, 2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.uptodate.com/contents/craniopharyngioma","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"Waltham, MA","publisher":"UpToDate"},{"referenceId":14842,"authors":"Hoffmann A, Özyurt J, Lohle K, Reichel J, Thiel CM, Müller HL","articleTitle":"First experiences with neuropsychological effects of oxytocin administration in childhood-onset craniopharyngioma.","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Endocrine","date":"April, 2017","volume":"56(1)","pages":"175-185","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28213803","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14843,"authors":"Hsu EA, Miller JL, Perez FA, Roth CL","articleTitle":"Oxytocin and Naltrexone Successfully Treat Hypothalamic Obesity in a Boy Post-Craniopharyngioma Resection","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Clin Endocrinol Metab","date":"February 1, 2018","volume":"103(2)","pages":"370-375","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29220529","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14844,"authors":"Daubenbüchel AM, Hoffmann A, Eveslage M, et al","articleTitle":"Oxytocin in survivors of childhood-onset craniopharyngioma","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Endocrine","date":"November, 2016","volume":"54(2)","pages":"524-531","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27585663","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":1804,"questionText":"What is the long-term outlook for craniopharyngioma?","answerText":"The prognosis for each patient depends on several factors, including the ability of the tumor to be completely removed and the presence of neurological problems or hormonal imbalances caused by the tumor prior to treatment, as well as caused by the treatment itself.
