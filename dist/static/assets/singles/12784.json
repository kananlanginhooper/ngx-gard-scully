These symptoms can persist for months to years and the ulcers often recur.&nbsp;Livedoid vasculopathy lesions appear as painful red or purple marks and spots that may progress to small, tender, irregular ulcers. Symptoms tend to worsen in the winter and summer months, and affect women more often then men.

General treatment measures may involve protecting the skin from injury and irritants, removing dead tissue from the ulcers, treating infection with antibiotics, elevating legs, compression therapy, and avoiding smoking and hormonal contraceptives.[9655][9656] Treatments will also be given to address any co-occurring conditions such as lupus or thrombophilia. Drugs that aim to improve blood flow or prevent blood clotting may also be considered. Examples of these treatments, include:[9655][9656]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAntiplatelet agents (e.g. aspirin, dipyridamole)<br />\r\nFibrinolytic agents (e.g. danazol, tissue plasminogen activator)<br />\r\nAnticoagulant agents (e.g. subcutaneous heparin injections, oral warfarin)<br />\r\nPentoxifylline <br />\r\nLow-dose danazol (200 mg/day orally)<br />\r\nHyperbaric oxygen<br />\r\nPulsed intravenous immunoglobulin <br />\r\nIloprost <br />\r\nKetanserin<br />\r\nPsoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy <br />\r\nNiacin (nicotinic acid)<br />\r\n<span class=\"glyph\"></span>Sulfapyridine <br />\r\n<span class=\"glyph\"></span>Guanethidine <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrently there are no established guidelines for treatment.
