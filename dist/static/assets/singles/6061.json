People with this disorder also experience narrowing of the field of vision (tunnel vision) and decrease in the ability to see details (visual acuity). The vision problems are due to loss of cells in the <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002291.htm\" target=\"_blank\">retina</a>&nbsp;(light sensitive part of the eye) and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002318.htm\" target=\"_blank\">choroid</a>&nbsp;(blood vessels in the eye).
