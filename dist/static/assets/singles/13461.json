In the teenage years, patients may develop a painful type of arthritis called gout. As an adult, the anemia improves but patients develop slowly progressive chronic kidney disease, which may lead to the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation between 40 and 80 years of age.[14425][15291][15292] ADTKD-REN is caused by a mistake (mutation) in one copy of the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/REN/\" target=\"_blank\">REN</a></em> gene.
