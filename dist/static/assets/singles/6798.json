This combination of features result in a \"crab-like\" appearance to the rib cage. Although the neck and midsection of individuals with spondylothoracic dysostosis are shortened, the arms and legs grow normally. As such, individuals with spondylothoracic dysostosis have short stature and are said to have short-trunk dwarfism.[2269][11048]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe spine and rib abnormalities may cause other complications. Infants with this condition are born with a small chest that cannot expand appropriately. This often leads to life-threatening breathing problems. As the lungs expand, the narrow chest forces the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) down and the abdomen is pushed out. The increased pressure in the abdomen can cause a soft out-pouching around the lower abdomen (inguinal <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hernia.html\" target=\"_blank\">hernia</a>) or belly-button (umbilical hernia).[11048]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost individuals with spondylothoracic dysostosis have normal intelligence and neurological problems are infrequent.[261]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSymptom severity may vary from patient to patient with spondylothoracic dysostosis; however, symptoms tend to be the worse for individuals who carry two E230X&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MESP2\" target=\"_blank\">MESP2</a>&nbsp;</em>gene.[2269]","dateModified":"2017-03-29T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":261,"authors":"Kulkarni ML, Navaz SR, Vani HN, Manjunath KS, Matani D","articleTitle":"Jarchho-Levin syndrome.","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Indian J Pediatr","date":"2006 Mar","volume":"73(3)","pages":"245-7","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?Db=pubmed&Cmd=DetailsSearch&Term=16567923%5Buid%5D","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":2269,"authors":"Cornier AS, Staehling-Hampton K, Delventhal KM, Saga Y, Caubet JF, Sasaki N, Ellard S, Young E, Ramirez N, Carlo SE, Torres J, Emans JB, Turnpenny PD, Pourquié O","articleTitle":"Mutations in the MESP2 gene cause spondylothoracic dysostosis/Jarcho-Levin syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Am J Hum Genet","date":"2008 Jun","volume":"82(6)","pages":"1334-41","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18485326","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11048,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Spondylothoracic dysostosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"February 2011","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/spondylothoracic-dysostosis","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":359,"questionText":"How might spondylothoracic dysostosis be treated?&nbsp;","answerText":"There is no cure for spondylothoracic dysostosis.
