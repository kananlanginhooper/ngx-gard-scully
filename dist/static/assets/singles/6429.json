Symptoms typically begin between the ages of 40-60 years. The most common symptoms are sleep disturbance, psychiatric problems, weight loss, and balance problems. Other symptoms include high blood pressure, excess sweating, and difficulty controlling body temperature. These symptoms tend to get worse over time. FFI is usually fatal in 6-36 months.
