No genetic material is gained or lost in a balanced translocation, so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems. However, translocations can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Some people with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome inherit an <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/structuralchanges\" target=\"_blank\">unbalanced translocation</a> that deletes <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/basics/gene\" target=\"_blank\">genes</a> near one end of&nbsp;chromosome 4. A loss of these genes results in the intellectual disability, slow growth, and other health problems characteristic of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome.[1172]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf a parent is found to have a balanced translocation involving chromosome 4, they may be at risk of having additional children with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome.&nbsp;Once a translocation is found, other family members can also be tested to see if they are carriers of the same balanced translocation.","dateModified":"2016-08-22T00:00:00","references":[{"referenceId":1172,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference Website","date":"April 2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/wolf-hirschhorn-syndrome","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":1914,"questionText":"Is chromosome analysis covered by insurance?
