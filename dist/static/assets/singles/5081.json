It may occur as an isolated finding or may be a symptom of a genetic syndrome. There are over 300 genetic syndromes that involve syndactyly, such as <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/5833/apert-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Apert syndrome</a> and <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7598/saethre-chotzen-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</a>. There are many different ways to classify or group non-syndromic (isolated) syndactyly.  Presently, researchers classify the different types of syndactyly based on how severe the syndactyly is, which digits are involved, how the trait appears to run through families, and whether an underlying <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a>  <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a>  has been identified. Using this system, nine different non-syndromic types of syndactyly have been defined.[12778][12779]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSyndactyly is caused by a mixture of genetic and environmental factors. In about 10-40% of individuals with syndactyly, there is a family history.[12780] Syndactyly can run through families in many different ways, depending on the underlying cause.
