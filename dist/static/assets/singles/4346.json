Although the signs and symptoms vary depending on the specific type, the most common symptom of ADCA is poor movement coordination (<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003198.htm\" target=\"_blank\">ataxia</a>) especially a jerky, unsteady walking style (gait). Coordination of hands and clearness of speech (<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007470.htm\" target=\"_blank\">dysarthria</a>) are also affected. &nbsp;The area of the brain controlling balance and movement decreases in size (<a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/cerebellar_degeneration/cerebellar_degeneration.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cerebellar atrophy</a>). This can be seen on <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003791.htm\" target=\"_blank\">brain imaging</a>. &nbsp; The ataxia usually slowly worsens over time. &nbsp;While the age of onset can vary, the symptoms most commonly begin during adult years.

Inheritance is <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> . Diagnosis of ADCA is based on clinical history, physical examination, <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/testing/genetictesting\" target=\"_blank\">genetic testing</a>, and ruling out other diseases. While there is still no cure, treatment options for specific symptoms may be available, depending on the type and severity of symptoms.
