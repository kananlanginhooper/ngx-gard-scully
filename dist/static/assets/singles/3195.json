It is most commonly found in otherwise healthy women between the ages of 30 and 70 years. GLPLS is characterized by three features: progressive patchy scarring hair loss of the scalp (<a href=\"https://www.niams.nih.gov/health_Info/Cicatricial_Alopecia/\" target=\"_blank\">cicatricial alopecia</a>), non-scarring thinning of the hair in the armpits and groin (noncicatricial alopecia), and spiky rough bumps based around hair follicles (<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/3247/lichen-planopilaris\" target=\"_blank\">follicular lichen planus</a>). Sometimes individuals with GLPLS experience itching around affected areas, which can be severe.[13251][13252][13253] The cause of this condition is not known; however, over the years, researchers have suggested theories that it may develop in relation to genetic factors, viral exposures, hormonal changes, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/immunesystemanddisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">immune system</a> issues, stress, and vitamin deficiencies.[13251] Treatment focuses on slowing the progression of hair loss and may include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/steroids.html\" target=\"_blank\">corticosteroids</a>, retinoids (medications related to vitamin A),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/puva-photochemotherapy/\" target=\"_blank\">psoralen plus ultraviolet light A </a>(PUVA), <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/drugs.html\" target=\"_blank\">antimalarial medications</a>, and antibiotics.[13251][13252]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2017-03-23T11:30:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
