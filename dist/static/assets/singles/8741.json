The pulmonary artery\r\ntakes blood from the heart to the lungs. In the absence of a pulmonary\r\nartery, other blood vessels compensate by supplying blood to the\r\nlungs. Pressure can build inside these vessels and lead to heart and lung\r\ncomplications. UAPA can be left sided or\r\nright sided. It most often occurs alone, but can occur with other heart\r\nanomalies and birth defects. Signs and symptoms include repeat lung\r\ninfections, lower exercise tolerance, shortness of breath, chest pain, and\r\nfluid in the lungs. Risk for these symptoms increase with age.\r\nComplications of UAPA include, hemoptysis (coughing up blood), respiratory hemorrhage,\r\nand high blood pressure in the arteries to the lung (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/pulmonaryhypertension.html\">pulmonary\r\nhypertension</a>).
