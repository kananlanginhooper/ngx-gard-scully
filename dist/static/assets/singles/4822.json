One important factor is how the condition is inherited.[427]\r\n<p>Two unaffected people who each carry one copy of the mutated gene for an autosomal recessive disorder (carriers) have a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy of having a child affected by the disorder. The chance with each pregnancy of having an unaffected child who is a carrier of the disorder is 50 percent, and the chance that a child will not have the disorder and will not be a carrier is 25 percent.[427]</p>\r\n<p>To learn more about the specific risks to current or future members of your family, we recommend that seek the advice of a genetics professional.&nbsp;To learn more about what to expect from a genetics consultation, <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/consult\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.
