The severity varies from person to person.[449] The signs of ARPKD frequently begin before birth, so it is often called “infantile PKD” but some people do not develop symptoms until later in childhood or even adulthood. Children born with ARPKD often, but not always, develop kidney failure before reaching adulthood; babies with the worst cases die hours or days after birth due to respiratory difficulties or respiratory failure. Liver scarring occurs in all patients.[3348]&nbsp;The condition is caused by a <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary.cfm?key=mutation\" target=_blank>mutation</a> in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene=pkhd1\" target=_blank>PKHD1 gene</a>&nbsp;and is inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=_blank>autosomal recessive</a> manner.

Consideration of genetic counseling (including discussion of potential risks to offspring and reproductive options) is recommended for individuals who are affected, are carriers, or are at risk of being carriers.[3349]<br><br>Carrier testing for relatives of the affected individual&nbsp;is possible once the mutations have been identified in the family. If the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/disease-causing-mutation/\" target=_blank>disease-causing mutations</a> in the PKHD1 gene&nbsp;cannot be identified, carrier detection using linkage analysis may be possible in families with at least one affected child and in which informative linked markers have been identified.[3349]<br><br>For high-risk pregnancies (i.e., those at 25% risk based on family history), prenatal testing for pregnancies at 25% risk is possible by analysis of DNA from fetal cells obtained by <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003921.htm\" target=_blank>amniocentesis</a> (usually performed at approximately 15 to 18 weeks gestation) or <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003406.htm\" target=_blank>chorionic villus sampling</a> (CVS), at approximately&nbsp;10 to 12 weeks gestation. This is a means of finding out the genetic status of the fetus during the pregnancy.&nbsp;However, both disease-causing alleles (the two inherited mutations)&nbsp;of an affected family member must be identified, or linkage established, in the family before prenatal testing can be performed. There is currently no reliable available on the sensitivity and specificity of prenatal ultrasound examination in diagnosis of ARPKD in pregnancies at 25% risk.[3349]<br><br>As an alternative to prenatal diagnosis during the pregnancy, <a href=\"https://www.asrm.org/FACTSHEET_Preimplantation_genetic_testing/\" target=_blank>preimplantation genetic diagnosis</a> (PGD) may be available for families in which the disease-causing mutations have been identified.[3349] Preimplantation diagnosis is used following <a href=\"http://www.americanpregnancy.org/infertility/ivf.html\" target=_blank>in vitro fertilization</a> to diagnose a genetic disease or condition in a preimplantation embryo (before it is introduced into the uterus). PGD allows prenatal testing to occur months earlier than conventional tests such as amniocentesis or CVS, even before a pregnancy begins. Doctors can test a single cell from an eight-cell embryo that is just days old. Individuals who may consider PGD include those at risk of transmitting a genetic disorder (such as ARPKD) to their offspring. The number of monogenic disorders (those caused&nbsp;by mutations in a single gene)&nbsp;that have been diagnosed in preimplantation embryos has increased each year. So far, hundreds of healthy babies have been born worldwide after undergoing the procedure, and the number is growing rapidly. Other things that may be determined during PGD are whether the embryo is a male or female,&nbsp;or whether it is carrying chromosomal abnormalities or rearrangements.&nbsp;PGD techniques have also been&nbsp;used to increase implantation rates, reduce the incidence of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), and prevent offspring with trisomies (such as Down syndrome) in women of advanced maternal age undergoing fertility treatment.[3350]<br><br>For a list of laboratories offering PGD, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GeneTests/lab/clinical_lab_service_id/3036?db=genetests\" target=_blank>click here</a>.","dateModified":"2011-04-26T10:20:00","references":[{"referenceId":3349,"authors":"Katherine MacRae Dell, Ellis D Avner","articleTitle":"Polycystic Kidney Disease, Autosomal Recessive","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"July 14, 2009","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1326/","dateAccessed":"2011-04-26T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":3350,"authors":"Kathi E.
