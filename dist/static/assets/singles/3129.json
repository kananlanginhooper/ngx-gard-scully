Symptoms in a newborn include generalized muscle stiffness while awake (<a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Hypertonia-Information-Page\" target=\"_blank\">hypertonia</a>) and exaggerated <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003293.htm\" target=\"_blank\">startle reflex</a> to unexpected loud noises, visual stimuli, or touch. Following the startle reaction, infants experience a brief period in which they are very rigid and are unable to move. During these rigid periods, some infants may stop breathing (apnea), which can be fatal and has been associated with <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001566.htm\" target=\"_blank\">sudden infant death syndrome</a>\r\n(SIDS). Muscle stiffness usually fades completely during the first few years of life. However the exaggerated startle reflex and periods of rigidity may continue throughout a person's life. Depending on the severity of the continued symptoms, a child or adult with hereditary hyperekplexia may have an increased risk of falling or otherwise injuring themselves. In some cases, children with hereditary hyperekplexia may have mild <a href=\"https://www.understood.org/en/learning-attention-issues/treatments-approaches/early-intervention/what-you-need-to-know-about-developmental-delays\" target=\"_blank\">developmental delays</a>.[14073][14074][14075] <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/9028.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Abdominal hernias</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000971.htm\" target=\"_blank\">congenital  dislocation of the hip</a> have also been associated with hereditary hyperekplexia.[14074][14075] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiagnosis of hereditary hyperekplexia requires the three main features: generalized stiffness immediately after birth, excessive startle reflex to unexpected stimuli, and a short period of generalized stiffness following the startle response.[14074][3846] Of note, the results of routine blood tests, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/urinalysis.html\" target=\"_blank\">urinalysis</a>, brain <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diagnosticimaging.html\" target=\"_blank\">imaging studies</a>, or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003931.htm\" target=\"_blank\">EEG</a>&nbsp;are usually normal.[14073][14074][14075] Hereditary hyperekplexia has different inheritance patterns and is associated with changes (<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>)&nbsp;in at least five <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/basics/gene\" target=\"_blank\">genes</a>.
