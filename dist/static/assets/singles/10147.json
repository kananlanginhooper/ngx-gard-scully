Treatment of hearing loss may include determining which aids would be most helpful, for example hearing aids&nbsp;or vibrotactile devices; cochlear implantation may be considered in children over age 12 months with severe-to-profound hearing loss. Early hearing intervention through amplification, surgery, or cochlear implantation may be recommended for children who are at risk to lose their hearing before they learn to speak.[1903] \r\n<p>People with hereditary hearing loss often require regular follow-up with a hearing specialist such as an audiologist to monitor stability or progression of the hearing loss.[1903] </p>\r\n<p>Treatment of branchial fistulae or cysts may require surgery.
