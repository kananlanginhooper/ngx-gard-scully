They are thought to arise from the cells that surround and insulate the nerve cells in our body (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0025728/\" target=\"_blank\">Schwann cells</a>). Most granular cell tumors are benign (non-cancerous), although some may be locally aggressive. Less than 2% are malignant (cancerous), but these are aggressive and often are associated with a poor prognosis.[12432] GCTs a</span>ffect females more often than males and usually present as a solitary painless mass. A few individuals have multiple GCTs.[12433] In most cases, these tumors are located in the skin of the head and neck, especially inside the mouth (70%), the tongue being the most common site. They may also occur in the breast, heart, <a href=\"https://www.pituitary.org.uk/information/what-is-the-pituitary-gland/\" target=\"_blank\">pituitary gland</a>, stomach, esophagus, genitalia, and upper respiratory tract.[12434][12435] GCTs may be&nbsp;&nbsp;part of some genetic syndromes, such as <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/1100/leopard-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">LEOPARD syndrome</a> and <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10420/neurofibromatosis\" target=\"_blank\">neurofibromatosis</a>.&nbsp;Complete surgical removal of the tumor is usually curative, but in some cases the tumors may recur.[12435]<br />","dateModified":"2016-10-25T18:51:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
