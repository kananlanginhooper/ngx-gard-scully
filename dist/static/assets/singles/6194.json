The human heart normally has four chambers, two ventricles and two atria. The two atria are normally&nbsp;separated from each other by a partition called the atrial septum and the two ventricles by the ventricle septum. In cor triatriatum there is a small extra chamber above the left atrium (cor triatriatum sinistrum) or right atrium (cor triatriatum dextrum). The presence of this extra atrial chamber can cause slowed passage of the blood from the lungs to the heart and, over time, lead to features of congestive heart failure and obstruction.[5930][5931] In children, cor triatriatum may be associated with major congenital cardiac problems. In adults, it is often an isolated finding.[5931] Treatment depends upon the symptoms present and may include medical or surgical approaches.[5932]","dateModified":"2013-03-21T15:29:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":8610,"authors":"Shirani J","articleTitle":"Cor Triatriatum","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"December 18, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/154168-overview","dateAccessed":"2015-04-06T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12483,"relatedDiseaseName":"Cor triatriatum dexter","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12484,"relatedDiseaseName":"Cor triatriatum sinister","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
