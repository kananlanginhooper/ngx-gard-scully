In severe cases symptoms may include &nbsp;persistent and very low levels of blood's sugar in newborns (neonatal hypoglycemia), failure to thrive, build-up of lactic acid in the blood (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000391.htm\" target=\"_blank\">lactic acidosis</a>), liver enlargement (hepatomegaly) and liver failure leading to neurological degeneration. Milder cases present during childhood with fewer and less serious liver problems. Infections and fasting may trigger the symptoms.[13797][13798] PEPCK1 deficiency inheritance is autosomal recessive. It is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PCK1\" target=\"_blank\">PEPCK1</a></em> gene.[13799] Some researchers believe that the severity of the disease depend upon the mutations resulting in less or more PEPCK1 activity (the more active the enzyme is, the less severe the disease is, and vice versa). Treatment depend on the symptoms and may include giving extra carbohydrates during heavy exercise and illness or other times of fasting (formal sick day regimen) by the dietitian.[13798]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPEPCK1 is the cytosolic form of the <a href=\"http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=EN&amp;Expert=2880\" target=\"_blank\">phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) enzyme</a>, the other being the mitochondrial (<a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/261650\" target=\"_blank\">PEPCK2</a>).[13800]&nbsp;<br />","dateModified":"2017-09-12T13:34:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
