Other signs and symptoms may include disproportionate fat distribution, overgrowth of the extremities (arms and legs), skin abnormalities and kidney problems such as an unusually small or absent kidney.[12326][12320][12321] The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary significantly from person to person. CLOVES syndrome is caused by <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=46586\" target=\"_blank\">somatic mutations</a> in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PIK3CA\" target=\"_blank\">PIK3CA</a> gene.[12320][12325] Because these mutations do not affect egg or sperm cells, the condition is not passed on from parent to child.

Palliative care aims to relieve symptoms caused by masses and minimize disease progression and disability.&nbsp;Management is very individualized because symptoms can vary in severity and body location for each person. Follow-up with various specialists is recommended every 6 months until the end of puberty, to assess for overgrowth and complications.[12320]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMedical treatment may include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007277.htm\" target=\"_blank\">embolization</a> and surgical removal of masses, especially those that are large, deep, or in the spinal region.[12320] <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sclerotherapy/home/ovc-20167803\" target=\"_blank\">Sclerotherapy</a> may be used in adults to lessen pain and reduce the size of vascular and lymphatic malformations.[12320]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOrthopedic and neurosurgical checkups with possible surgical intervention are needed to reduce complications from overgrowth. Surveillance of hands, feet, and limb abnormalities is important so surgery can be done promptly to minimize limb disfigurement and loss of function. Because there is increased risk of tumor growth in people with overgrowth syndromes, people with CLOVES syndrome should have surveillance for tumors and have masses assessed.[12320]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn general, the earlier surveillance and intervention are started, the better the outcome.[12320]","dateModified":"2017-05-09T10:13:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":12320,"authors":"Anderson S, Brooks SS","articleTitle":"An Extremely Rare Disorder of Somatic Mosaicism: CLOVES Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Adv Neonatal Care","date":"October 2016","volume":"16(5)","pages":"347-359","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13404,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Frequently Asked Questions -- Compiled from doctors, families, and people with CLOVES","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"CLOVES Syndrome Community","date":"February 2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.clovessyndrome.org/content/faqs","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12182,"relatedDiseaseName":"PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
