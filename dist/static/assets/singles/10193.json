In SPTCL, people develop multiple painless nodules in the fat layer under the skin and can these cause swelling. This is known as panniculitis. The cause of this type of cancer is unknown, but genetic factors may be involved.[15235] It can be diagnosed by a skin biopsy of the affected area. Treatment for SPTCL depends on the symptoms&nbsp;but often involves taking a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/steroids.html\" target=\"_blank\">steroid</a> medication or a medication that lessens the immune response. Some people with more aggressive SPTCL may need chemotherapy. SPTCL can occur in children or adults, but is typically diagnosed in the 30s. For&nbsp;unknown reasons,&nbsp;it occurs more often in women than men.[15233]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSPTCL is a very slow-growing cancer and does not usually spread beyond the subcutaneous fat layer. About 20% of people with SPTCL will also develop another condition called <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6589/hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis\" target=\"_blank\">hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)</a>[15235] in which the body makes too many immune cells.
