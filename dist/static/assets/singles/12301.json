Symptoms typically begin in childhood and vary from person to person. They may include<span>&nbsp;muscle stiffness, muscle weakness, and attacks of weakness brought on by movement after rest.&nbsp;</span>There are two forms of myotonia congenita: <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/844/Myotonia_congenita_autosomal_recessive.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Becker disease</a>, which is the most common and severe, generalized form; and <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/6176/Myotonia_congenita_autosomal_dominant.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Thomsen disease</a>, which is a rare and milder form.[488] Both forms are caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary.cfm?key=mutation\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in the <a class=\"link-dapple\" title=\"C L C N 1\" href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene=clcn1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>CLCN1</em></a> gene. The Becker type is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and the Thomsen type is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.[489] Treatment may include medication for muscle stiffness, &nbsp;such as <a href=\"https://www.drugs.com/pro/mexiletine.html\" target=\"_blank\">mexiletine</a>, <a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1493-5/carbamazepine-oral/carbamazepine---oral/details\" target=\"_blank\">carbamazepine</a>, or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682022.html\" target=\"_blank\">phenytoin</a>. Exercise may temporarily alleviate myotonia. People with myotonia congenita may be at increased risk for harmful side effects of anesthesia.
