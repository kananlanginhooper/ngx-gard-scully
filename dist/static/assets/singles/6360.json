It is thought to be an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/autoimmunediseases.html\" target=\"_blank\">autoimmune disorder</a>, which means that the immune system attacks healthy cells by mistake. In EBA, certain immune proteins (usually IgG autoantibodies) mistakenly target and attack a specific type of collagen (a skin protein) involved in \"anchoring\" the skin.[7221][7224] In some milder cases of EBA, the immune proteins involved are thought to be IgA, rather than IgG autoantibodies. The initiating event that leads to autoantibody production is unknown.[7224]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEBA affecting several family members has been reported, suggesting a genetic component may be involved in some cases.

Affected individuals with involvement of the gastrointestinal tract should be referred to a gastroenterologist. Likewise, dentists and ophthalmologists should be consulted for those with oral and ocular (eye) involvement. Medications used to treat EBA include oral <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/steroids.html\" target=\"_blank\">corticosteroids </a>(such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601102.html\" target=\"_blank\">prednisone</a>), anti-inflammatory agents (such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682128.html\" target=\"_blank\">dapsone</a> or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682711.html\" target=\"_blank\">colchicine</a>), and medications that suppress the immune system (such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682167.html\" target=\"_blank\">azathioprine</a> or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682080.html\" target=\"_blank\">cyclophosphamide</a>). Patients who are on long-term oral steroid treatment may be advised to take calcium, vitamin D, and, perhaps, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000502.htm\" target=\"_blank\">bisphosphonates</a> to reduce the risk of osteoporosis that can be associated with steroid use. <a href=\"http://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/extracorporeal-photopheresis/\" target=\"_blank\">Extracorporeal photochemotherapy </a>(photophoresis) has been shown to be effective in some cases. In patients who do not respond to other therapies, medications such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a607038.html\" target=\"_blank\">rituximab</a> may be considered. Patients with EBA should avoid contact sports and direct physical trauma to the skin whenever possible and may be instructed to use protective pads to cover skin surfaces when undergoing planned physical activities. Patients with oral involvement should avoid hard foods such as pretzels, nuts, and chips. Patients with EBA should be monitored regularly by physicians with experience in treating autoimmune skin disease. During the active disease stage, patients should be monitored on a monthly basis; when in remission, patients should be monitored annually.[12911]\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","dateModified":"2017-01-11T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":12911,"authors":"Croom, Daniel","articleTitle":"Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape","date":"April 29, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1063083-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":5520,"questionText":"How can I connect with other people with&nbsp;epidermolysis bullosa acquisita?","answerText":"<p>Currently we are not aware of a support group or online community specifically for people with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA).&nbsp;However, you may still be able to connect with other's through the following online rare disease communities.
