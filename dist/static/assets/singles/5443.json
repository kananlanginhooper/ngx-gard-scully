Results of an ultrasound may give information about whether additional ultrasounds (or a more specialized ultrasound) may be indicated, or if another type of fetal testing may be indicated. A normal ultrasound result may help to provide relief to individuals with a family history of a condition such as VACTERL association. In addition to a fetal ultrasound, <a href=\"http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4686\" target=_blank>fetal echocardiography</a>&nbsp;can be performed, which can provide a detailed picture of&nbsp;the&nbsp;fetal heart.

Therefore, the diagnosis of VACTERL association is typically based on features that are seen when a baby is born or in the first few days of life. The diagnosis is based on having <em>at least three </em>of the following features (which make up the acronym VACTERL): vertebral defects, commonly accompanied by rib anomalies; <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001147.htm\" target=\"_blank\">imperforate anus</a> or <a href=\"http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/anal+atresia\" target=\"_blank\">anal atresia</a>; cardiac (heart)&nbsp;defects; <a href=\"http://www.seattlechildrens.org/medical-conditions/chromosomal-genetic-conditions/tef-and-ea/\" target=\"_blank\">tracheo-esophageal fistula</a> with or without <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000961.htm\" target=\"_blank\">esophageal atresia</a>; renal (kidney) anomalies including <a href=\"http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/fh/mcshn/bd/renal.htm\" target=\"_blank\">renal agenesis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.urologyhealth.org/urology/index.cfm?article=21\" target=\"_blank\">horseshoe kidney</a>, and cystic and/or dysplastic kidneys; and limb abnormalities.[6090]<br />\n<br />\nAdditional types of abnormalities have also been reported in affected individuals and may be used as clues in considering a diagnosis of other conditions with overlapping features.
