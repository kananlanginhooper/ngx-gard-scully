It results in the development of small particles or granules (like breadcrumbs) on the cornea (known as granular corneal dystrophy) and the development of lesions that resemble cracked glass (known as lattice corneal dystrophy). These eye lesions&nbsp;usually develop on the stromal layer before age 20.&nbsp;As affected individuals age, the lesions may become larger, more prominent, and involve the entire stromal layer. Some older individuals have decreased clarity of vision (decreased <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003396.htm\" target=_blank>visual acuity</a>) due&nbsp;to <a href=\"http://\" target=_blank>clouding of the cornea</a>&nbsp;(opacity). Recurrent erosions of the eye from the granules may develop in some cases.[3246][3247] <br><br>The first reported cases could be traced to the Avellino region of Italy, which is how this form of the condition was named. Recent reports have described families from all around the world with this condition. The Avellino type of corneal dystrophy is inherited in an <a href=\"http://\" target=_blank>autosomal dominant</a>&nbsp;manner and is caused by <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\" target=_blank>mutations</a> in the <em>TGFBI</em> <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/basics/gene\" target=_blank>gene</a>.[3246][3247]","dateModified":"2011-04-07T14:23:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":4315,"questionText":"How might corneal dystrophy, Avellino type be treated?","answerText":"There is no cure for this condition and treatment usually focuses on alleviating symptoms, especially when vision becomes significantly impaired.
