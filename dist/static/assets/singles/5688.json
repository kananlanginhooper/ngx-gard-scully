Children with Temtamy syndrome typically look different than other children. They may have a long face, widely-spaced eyes (<a href=\"https://www.childrens.com/specialties-services/specialty-centers-and-programs/plastic-craniofacial-surgery/programs-and-services/craniofacial-program/conditions-and-treatments/hypertelorism\">hypertelorism</a>), a large nose, and a small chin (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003306.htm\">micrognathia</a>). Some children with Temtamy syndrome have relatively large heads (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003305.htm\">macrocephaly</a>). These facial features may be present from birth. Other physical features of the syndrome may include having short fingers and toes (<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/11913/brachydactyly\">brachydactyly</a>), bowed legs, or flat feet (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001262.htm\">pes planus</a>).[14548][14549][14550]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople with Temtamy syndrome may have differences in the brain that can be seen on brain imaging. The most common feature is having a part of the brain, called the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/8753.htm\">corpus callosum</a>, that is smaller than expected, completely absent, or may be unusually thick. The corpus callosum is the bundle of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0024271/\" target=\"_blank\">nerves fibers</a>&nbsp;that allows information to easily and quickly travel from one side of the brain to the other (between the left and right hemisphere). Problems in the development of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vumc.com/branch/children-white-matter-disorders/419542/\" target=\"_blank\">white matter of the brain</a>&nbsp;may also be present. The white matter is the part of the brain made up of nerve fibers and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002261.htm\" target=\"_blank\">myelin</a>. Myelin forms a fatty, protective layer around nerve fibers, insulating the fibers so nerve signals pass through quickly.[14548][14549][14550]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther neurological symptoms of Temtamy syndrome can include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/seizures.html\">seizures</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001523.htm\">intellectual disability</a>. Children with Temtamy syndrome may have low muscle tone (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003298.htm\">hypotonia</a>) and they may meet milestones such as sitting up or walking later than other children do (<a href=\"http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/devdel.htm\">developmental delay</a>).
