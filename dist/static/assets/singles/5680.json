People with this condition are genetically male, with one X and one Y chromosome in each cell, and they have male gonads (testes). Their bodies, however, do not produce enough of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is critical for male sexual&nbsp;development. Most are&nbsp;born with external genitalia that appear female. In other cases, affected individuals may have <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003269.htm\" target=_blank>ambiguous genitalia</a>.&nbsp;Others may&nbsp;have genitalia that appear predominantly male, often with an unusually small penis (micropenis) and the urethra opening on the underside of the penis (hypospadias).&nbsp;This condition is caused by <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\" target=_blank>mutations</a> in the <a class=\"geneSymbol \" title=\"S R D 5 A 2\" href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SRD5A2\" target=_blank><span><em>SRD5A2</em></span></a> gene and is&nbsp;inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=_blank>autosomal recessive</a>&nbsp;pattern.[4715]","dateModified":"2011-12-02T13:07:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
