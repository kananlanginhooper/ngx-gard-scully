In the kidneys, the excess oxalate combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate, a hard compound that is the main component of kidney stones. Deposits of calcium oxalate can lead to kidney damage, kidney failure, and injury to other organs. Primary hyperoxaluria type 2 is caused by the shortage (deficiency) of an enzyme called glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR) that normally prevents the buildup of oxalate. This enzyme shortage is caused by mutations in the <span class=geneSymbol><em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GRHPR\" target=_blank>GRHPR</a></em></span> gene. Primary hyperoxaluria type 2 is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=_blank>autosomal recessive</a> pattern.[5725]","dateModified":"2013-01-03T12:14:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6642,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of primary hyperoxaluria type 2?","answerText":"Primary hyperoxaluria type 2 is characterized by recurrent <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000458.htm\" target=_blank>nephrolithiasis</a> (deposition of calcium oxalate in the kidney and urinary tract), nephrocalcinosis (deposition of calcium oxalate in the kidney tissue), and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000500.htm\" target=_blank>end-stage renal disease</a> (ESRD).
