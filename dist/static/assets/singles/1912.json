Over time, drusen may enlarge and come together, creating a honeycomb pattern. At this point, patients may start to notice changes in their visual acuity (the clarity or sharpness of vision). &nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTypically, people with DHRD do not have symptoms until 30-40 years of age.&nbsp;Early visual symptoms may include: decreased&nbsp;visual acuity; problems seeing color; relative scotomas (a defect in the visual field resulting in problems seeing objects of low brightness);&nbsp;photophobia (eye discomfort in bright light);&nbsp;and&nbsp;metamorphopsia (distorted vision). [1]<br />\n<br />\nIn the later stages of the condition, usually by&nbsp;the age of 40 to 50 years, one's central vision deteriorates. Additionally, absolute scotomas can develop. These visual&nbsp;defects (which are surrounded by normal visual field)&nbsp;are associated with total loss of vision within that specific area. [1]<br />\n<br />\nDHRD is usually characterized by slowly progressive loss of central visual acuity.&nbsp;To some extent,&nbsp;the&nbsp;degree of severity is associated with age.&nbsp;Mild cases are usually detected between 20 to 40 years of age.
