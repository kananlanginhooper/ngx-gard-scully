Treatment of pulmonary AVMs  may also be performed to prevent lung <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bleeding.html\" target=\"_blank\">hemorrhage</a> and the neurologic complications of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000783.htm\" target=\"_blank\">brain abscesses</a> and/or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/stroke.html\" target=\"_blank\">stroke</a>. Treatment may include inserting a small inflated balloon or small metal coil in the artery that leads into the AVM in order to stop the blood flow through the AVM (embolotherapy) or surgical removal of the AVM.[2428][2427] People with pulmonary AVMs are advised to take extra precautions to avoid serious complications. These recommendations include taking antibiotics before dental or surgical procedures, using special filters in IV lines to prevent even tiny air bubbles from entering the blood stream, avoiding <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bloodthinners.html\" target=\"_blank\">blood thinners</a> and <a href=\"http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=a00284\" target=\"_blank\">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</a> (such as aspirin, ibuprofin, and naproxen), and regular monitoring by a doctor familiar with HHT.[2427]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAVMs in the brain (cerebral AVMs) greater than 1.0 cm in diameter may be surgically removed. Alternative treatment includes inserting a small inflated balloon or glue-like substance to stop the blood flow through the artery involved in the AVM (embolotherapy) and/or using a narrow, focused beam of radiation to destroy the AVM (stereotactic radiosurgery).[2428][2427] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAVMs in the liver (hepatic AVMs) are currently treated only if a person shows signs of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/heartfailure.html\" target=\"_blank\">heart failure</a> or significant health problems related to the liver not working properly. Treatment might include standard heart failure medications, liver transplantation, or medications like <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a607001.html\" target=\"_blank\">bevacizumab</a>.[2427]</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"freepp\" target=\"_blank\" xmlns:ax=\"http://www.adam.com\">In addition, guidelines for people with HHT recommend annual evaluations for anemia and neurologic conditions and re-evaluation for pulmonary AVMs every one to two years during childhood and every five years thereafter. Blood tests to check for anemia may be recommended more often depending on the frequency and severity of nose bleeds or if an intestinal or stomach AVM is bleeding. Women with HHT considering pregnancy are screened and treated for pulmonary AVMs; if pulmonary AVMs are discovered during pregnancy, they are treated during the second trimester.[2428]</p>","dateModified":"2017-10-13T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":2427,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Diagnosis & Treatment","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Cure HHT","date":"","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://curehht.org/understanding-hht/diagnosis-treatment/","dateAccessed":"2018-03-14T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":2428,"authors":"McDonald J & Pyeritz RE","articleTitle":"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1351/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":3487,"questionText":"What types of medical professionals can treat and provide ongoing care to&nbsp;individuals with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)?<br />","answerText":"The HHT Foundation recommends that people with HHT be assessed at least once at a specialized HHT Center. These centers facilitate the comprehensive coordination of care necessary for treating a patient who has HHT by proactively managing the care of patients with HHT. At these centers, a coordinated team of experts, knowledgeable about HHT, collectively cares for the patients seen at the Center. In most cases, a full-time nurse works closely with the specialists to care for the patient. Usually there is a coordinator on site to ensure proper follow up and coordination of patients care throughout the Center.[11305]\r\n<p class=\"freepp\" xmlns:ax=\"http://www.adam.com\" target=\"_blank\">Each Center provides medical services that are currently being provided at that facility, but will provide these services in a more organized and consistent fashion.
