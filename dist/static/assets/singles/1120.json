Symptoms of this condition often appear early in life and include low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and low levels of ketones, which are produced when the body breaks down fat for energy (hypoketotic hypoglycemia). This can lead to a greater risk for loss of consciousness or seizures. People with this disorder typically also have an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), muscle weakness, nervous system damage, and elevated levels of carnitine in the blood. CPT1A deficiency is caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>  in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CPT1A\" target=\"_blank\">CPT1A</a> </em>gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>  manner.
