As a result, these sugars buildup in cells, blood and connective tissue which can lead to a variety of health problems. Seven distinct forms and numerous subtypes of mucopolysaccharidosis have been identified. Associated signs and symptoms and the severity of the condition vary significantly by form. In general, most affected people appear healthy at birth and experience a period of normal development, followed by a decline in physical and/or mental function. As the condition progresses, it may affect appearance; physical abilities; organ and system functioning; and, in most cases, cognitive development. The underlying genetic cause varies by form. Most cases are inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>  manner, although one specific form (Type II) follows an <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=209\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked</a> pattern of inheritance.
