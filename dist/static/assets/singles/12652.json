The disease involves the legs more than the arms. It usually starts in childhood or adolescence, but in some cases not until adulthood. Difficulty speaking develops over time. Other symptoms may include: epilepsy; learning problems; cognitive decline; and reduced consciousness, neurologic deterioration, and fever following minor head trauma. Many affected individuals become wheelchair dependent in their teens or twenties. The earlier the onset the more severe the disease is. The diagnosis is made in persons who had the characteristic abnormalities observed on brain and spinal cord <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/mriscans.html\" target=\"_blank\">MRI scans </a>and with the genetic test identifiying the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DARS2\" target=\"_blank\"><em>DARS2</em></a> gene alteration (mutation).
