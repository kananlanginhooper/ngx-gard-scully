The exact mechanism that causes this loss of function is complex. People normally inherit one copy of the <em>UBE3A</em> gene from each parent. Both copies of this gene are turned on (active) in many of the body's tissues. In certain areas of the brain, however, only the copy inherited from a person's mother is active.

Examples of two such tests are prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Prenatal diagnosis can be used to diagnose a condition in a developing fetus. Today, doctors are able to diagnose many more birth defects than they are able to treat before birth. If a fetus has a condition for which prenatal treatment is not possible, prenatal diagnosis may help parents prepare emotionally for the birth and to plan the delivery with their health care providers.[1460] Parents can also use this information to make decisions regarding whether or not to continue the pregnancy.&nbsp;<br><br>PGD represents an alternative to prenatal diagnosis.[1461] It is used following in vitro fertilization to diagnose a genetic disease or condition in embryos. Only embryos that do not carry the disease-causing mutation&nbsp;are implanted in the mother's womb. PGD allows&nbsp;testing to occur before a pregnancy begins. <br><br>In many cases,&nbsp;the disease-causing mutation must be&nbsp;identified in an affected relative before PGD or prenatal diagnosis can be performed. \r\n<p>You can learn more about these and other tests by visiting the links below to the view information on this topic developed by the Centre for Genetic Education and by the Genetics and Public Policy Center:<br><a href=\"http://www.genetics.com.au/pntbooklet.pdf\">http://www.genetics.com.au/pntbooklet.pdf</a><br><a href=\"http://www.dnapolicy.org/policy.issue.php?action=detail&amp;issuebrief_id=7\">http://www.dnapolicy.org/policy.issue.php?action=detail&amp;issuebrief_id=7</a></p>\r\n<p>Couples considering these options should talk with their healthcare provider and a genetic professional. It is important that couples are fully informed of the risks and benefits of each testing option and also have an opportunity to explore their feelings and beliefs regarding the use of these technologies.&nbsp;More information about genetic consultations is available from Genetics Home Reference at <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/consult\" target=_blank>http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/consult</a>.
