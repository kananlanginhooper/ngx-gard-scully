Affected individuals have a high level of an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002223.htm\" target=_blank>antibody</a> called immunoglobulin M (IgM) in their blood, which can cause thickening of the blood (hyperviscosity).[6227] Although some individuals initially do not have symptoms and are diagnosed from routine blood work, common symptoms may include weakness, appetite loss and weight loss. Other symptoms may include <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/peripheralneuropathy/peripheralneuropathy.htm\" target=_blank>peripheral neuropathy</a>, fever, <a href=\"http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Raynauds_Phenomenon/raynauds_ff.asp\" target=_blank>Raynaud's phenomenon</a>, and mental status changes.[6228] Hyperviscosity of the blood may cause nosebleeds, headaches, dizziness, and blurring or loss of vision.[6227] The cause of the condition is not known but environmental, genetic, and viral factors have been suggested. There have been some reports of familial cases suggesting a genetic predisposition.
