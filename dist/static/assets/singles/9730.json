In Danon disease there is a defect in the wall (membrane) of the lysosome.

Males usually develop the signs and symptoms of the condition earlier than females and are more severely affected. In males, the symptoms typically present in childhood or adolescence, while females may not have symptoms until early adulthood.[11846][11847]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCardiomyopathy is the most common symptom of Danon disease and occurs in all males with the condition. Most (90%) affected men have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which causes the heart muscle to become thicker and more rigid than normal. A smaller number (10%) have dilated cardiomyopathy, which weakens and enlarges the heart. Both of these conditions affect the heart's ability to efficiently  pump blood through the body and can cause serious complications, including heart failure and premature death. Many women with Danon disease also develop cardiomyopathy. Of these women, about half develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the other half develop dilated cardiomyopathy.[11846][11847]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople with Danon disease may also have other heart-related signs and symptoms, including a fluttering or pounding in the chest (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003081.htm\" target=\"_blank\">palpitations</a>), an abnormal heartbeat (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001101.htm\" target=\"_blank\">arrhythmia</a>), or chest pain. Many affected individuals also have abnormalities of the electrical signals that control the heartbeat (conduction abnormalities). The most common conduction abnormality seen in individuals with Danon disease is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=wolffparkinsonwhitesyndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</a>.[11846][11847]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost men and about half of women with Danon disease also have skeletal <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001220.htm\" target=\"_blank\">myopathy</a>. The muscles most often affected are those in the back, upper arms, shoulders, neck, and thighs. Many men also have elevated levels of an enzyme called <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003504.htm\" target=\"_blank\">creatine kinase</a> (CPK) in their blood, which is an indicator of muscle disease.[11846][11847]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost men with Danon disease also have mild intellectual disability. In contrast, women tend to have normal intellectual development.
