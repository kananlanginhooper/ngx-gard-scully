Without an adequate blood supply, the bone cells die.[11950] LCPD&nbsp;usually occurs in children between the ages of 4 and 10.[11931] Early symptoms may include limping; pain in the hip, thigh or knee; and reduced range of hip motion.[11932]&nbsp;Later in the disease course, there may be leg length discrepancy (one leg longer than the other) and wasting of the muscles around the hip. The condition can last for several years before new bone formation (re-ossification) and eventual healing occurs.[11932] Some people with LCPD go on to develop degenerative arthritis in adulthood.[11931][1939]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe underlying cause of LCPD is often not known. Sometimes it results from a <a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/scfe.html\" target=\"_blank\">slipped capital femoral epiphysis</a>, trauma, steroid use, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/8614/sickle-cell-anemia/Resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">sickle-cell</a> crisis, <a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/toxic-synovitis.html\" target=\"_blank\">toxic synovitis</a>, or <a href=\"http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=a00347\" target=\"_blank\">congenital hip dysplasia</a>.[11931] It usually is not caused by genetic factors, but a few familial cases with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>&nbsp;inheritance have been reported.
