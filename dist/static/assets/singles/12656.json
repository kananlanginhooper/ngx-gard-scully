Unicentric CD is a \"localized\" condition that is generally confined to a single set of lymph nodes, while multicentric CD is a \"systemic\" disease that affects multiple sets of lymph nodes and other tissues throughout the body.[9161][9168] The exact underlying cause of CD is currently unknown; however, it is thought to occur <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/sporadic/\" target=\"_blank\">sporadically</a> in people with no family history of the condition.[9162] Treatment varies based on the form of the condition, the severity of symptoms and whether or not the affected person also has an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hivaids.html\" target=\"_blank\">HIV</a> and/or human herpes virus type 8 (HHV-8) infection.[9150]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor more specific information about each form of CD, please visit GARD's <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/6005/unicentric-castleman-disease/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">unicentric Castleman disease</a> and <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/9644/multicentric-castleman-disease/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">multicentric Castleman disease</a> pages.","dateModified":"2015-06-25T21:41:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":9014,"questionText":"What causes Castleman disease?","answerText":"The exact underlying cause of Castleman disease (CD) is poorly understood.
