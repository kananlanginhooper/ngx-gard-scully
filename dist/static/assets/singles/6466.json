Symptoms of FSS are present from birth, and include abnormally flexed joints (joint <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003185.htm\" target=\"_blank\">contractures</a>), spine abnormalities, and a characteristic facial appearance. People with FSS have a small mouth (microstomia) with pursed lips, giving the appearance of a \"whistling face\". In addition, they may have deep nasolabial folds (the skin between the nose and the lips) and a V-shaped chin dimple. There may be abnormalities of the eyes such as wide-spaced eyes (hypertelorism) and a narrowing of the eye opening (blepharophimosis). People with FSS often have breathing, eating, and speech problems. The joint and spine problems may get worse over time.&nbsp;FSS is thought to be caused by variants&nbsp;in the <em><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/myh3\" target=\"_blank\">MYH3</a></em> gene. Most cases occur by chance. Rarely, FSS is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>&nbsp;manner. Diagnosis is based on a specific set of symptoms, clinical exam, and may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing.
