Other symptoms may include the inability to make tears or feel pain, vomiting episodes, frequent pneumonia, and difficulty walking. Over time, the symptoms of FD tend to get worse and are often life-threatening. FD is caused by genetic variations in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ELP1\" target=\"_blank\">ELP1</a></em> gene, and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
