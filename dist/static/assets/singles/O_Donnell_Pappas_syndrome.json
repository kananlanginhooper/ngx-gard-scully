Foveal hypoplasia as an isolated entity is a rare phenomenon; it is usually described in association with other ocular disorders, such as aniridia (106210), microphthalmia (see 251600), albinism (see 203100), or achromatopsia (see 216900). All reported cases of foveal hypoplasia have been accompanied by decreased visual acuity and nystagmus (summary by Perez et al., 2014).Genetic Heterogeneity of Foveal HypoplasiaFoveal hypoplasia-2 (FVH2; 609218) is caused by mutation in the SLC38A8 gene (615585) on chromosome 16q23.","Disease__c":"O Donnell Pappas syndrome","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C3805604","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
