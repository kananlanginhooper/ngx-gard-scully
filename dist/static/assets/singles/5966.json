Brucellosis can cause of range of signs and symptoms, some of which may persist or recur. Initial symptoms may include fever, sweats, malaise, anorexia, headache, fatigue, and/or pain in the muscles, joints, and/or back. Symptoms that may persist or recur include fevers, arthritis, swelling of the testicle and scrotum, swelling of the heart (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/endocarditis.html\" target=\"_blank\">endocarditis</a>), neurologic symptoms (in up to 5% of cases), chronic fatigue, depression, and/or swelling of the liver or spleen. People who are in jobs or settings that increase exposure to the bacteria are at increased risk for infection. Antibiotics are used to treat brucellosis.[7988] Recovery may take a few weeks to several months, and relapses are common.[7988][7989] Death from brucellosis is rare, occurring in no more than 2% of cases.[7988]","dateModified":"2014-12-12T12:49:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":8025,"questionText":"What is the long-term outlook for people with brucellosis?","answerText":"The long-term outlook (prognosis) for most people with brucellosis is generally very good.
