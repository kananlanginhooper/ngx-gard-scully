Signs and symptoms may range from occasional difficulty saying a word or two to substantial difficulty speaking that interferes with communication. Spasmodic dysphonia causes the voice to have a tight, strained, or strangled quality. While the cause of spasmodic dysphonia is unknown, some researchers think it might be caused by problems with the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001069.htm\">basal ganglia</a> in the brain.[2473]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome cases of spasmodic dysphonia occur along with other diseases that affect the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/18125.htm\">nervous system</a> such as movement disorders. Spasmodic dysphonia may be inherited, or it may occur after a trauma to the voice box such as an injury or a severe cold.
