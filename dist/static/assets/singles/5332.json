Mosaic trisomy 20 is the most common type of chromosome 20 trisomy and is one of the more common chromosomal abnormalities found during prenatal diagnostic testing. Studies have shown that&nbsp;the child&nbsp;is normal in the&nbsp;vast majority of prenatally diagnosed individuals.

It is not always known why these errors occur, but it is thought that&nbsp;nothing that a parent does or doesn&rsquo;t do before or during pregnancy can cause a chromosomal abnormality in a fetus or child. Egg and sperm cells should each contain 23 chromosomes. When they join together, they form a fertilized egg with 46 chromosomes. Sometimes, something goes wrong before fertilization. An egg or sperm cell may divide incorrectly, resulting in an egg or sperm cell with too many or too few chromosomes. When this cell with the wrong number of chromosomes joins with a normal egg or sperm cell, the resulting embryo has a chromosomal abnormality. If an egg or sperm cell has 24 chromosomes because either has an extra copy of chromosome 20, this can cause <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=trisomy\" target=\"_blank\">trisomy</a> 20 (the resulting embryo will have 3 copies of chromsome 20). In most cases, an embryo with 3 full copies of chromosome 20 in all cells does not survive and the pregnant woman has a miscarriage,&nbsp;often very early in pregnancy. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther types of errors&nbsp;can alter the structure of one or more chromosomes. Individuals with structural chromosomal abnormalities usually have the normal number of chromosomes. However, small pieces of a chromosome (or chromosomes) may be duplicated, and in the case of part of chromosome 20 being duplicated, it would be called partial trisomy 20 (because there are 3 copies of only part of chromosome 20 in each cell). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nErrors in cell division involving chromosome 20&nbsp;can also occur soon after fertilization, which can cause&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001317.htm\" target=\"_blank\">mosaicism</a>, a condition in which an individual has cells with different genetic makeups.&nbsp;Individuals with the mosaic form of trisomy 20 have an extra chromosome 20 in some, but not all, of their cells.
