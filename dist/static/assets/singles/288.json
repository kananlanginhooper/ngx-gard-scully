Signs and symptoms include an unusually shaped skull, distinctive facial features, thin skin and hair, and eye and dental abnormalities.[5346] Other features include poor vision, a small upper airway, and short stature. HSS is diagnosed based on a physical examination that identifies the specific signs and symptoms that have been described in this condition.[15467] The cause of HSS is unknown and is thought to be due to a random genetic change.[15467] HSS is not thought to be inherited in families. Because this condition is so rare, little is known about how HSS changes over time. Problems with airway management and premature aging have been reported.[15470] Most people with HSS have normal intelligence.[15468] Treatment for HSS is based on the specific symptoms and may involve multiple surgeries.[5346][15470][15469]","dateModified":"2020-04-10T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":3190,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Hallermann-Streiff syndrome?","answerText":"The main features of Hallermann-Streiff syndrome include an unusually shaped skull and face, and abnormalities of the eyes, teeth, skin and hair.
