Cohen, Jr. When the syndrome was first described, it was believed that its main features were obesity, hypotonia (low muscle tone), intellectual disabilities, distinctive facial features with prominent upper central teeth and abnormalities of the hands and feet. Since Cohen syndrome was first described, over 100 cases have been reported worldwide. It is now known that the signs and symptoms present in people with Cohen syndrome may vary considerably. Although the exact cause of Cohen syndrome is unknown, some people with the condition have been found to have <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary.cfm?key=mutation\" target=_blank>mutations</a> in a <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary.cfm?key=gene\">gene</a> called <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene=vps13b\" target=_blank><em>COH1</em></a> (also&nbsp;referred to as <em>VPS13B</em>).
