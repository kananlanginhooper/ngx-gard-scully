It&nbsp;is a type of&nbsp;aminoaciduria. The condition may be diagnosed based on the results of newborn screening tests. Most people with the condition have no symptoms (asymptomatic). For those who do show symptoms, the onset of the disease is usually between the ages of 3 and 9; occasionally the disease may present in adulthood. Mental development is usually normal, though a few cases with intellectual impairment have been reported. The signs and symptoms of Hartnup disease incude skin photosensitivity, neurologic findings, psychiatric symptoms, and ocular (eye)&nbsp;findings. Hartnup disease is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SLC6A19\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">SLC6A19</a></em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SLC6A19\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\"> gene</a> and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> manner.[1][2]\r\nPeople with Hartnup disease may benefit from a high-protein diet, protection from sunlight, vitamin supplementation, and avoidance of certain drugs/medications.
