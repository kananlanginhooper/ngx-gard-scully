People with this condition may experience a sudden onset of photopsia (the presence of perceived flashes of light) and an area of partial vision loss (a blindspot). Other symptoms may include \"whitening of vision\" or blurred vision. Although anyone can be affected, the condition is most commonly diagnosed in young women (average age 36.7 years). The underlying cause of AZOOR is currently unknown; however, some researchers have proposed that <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/infectiousdiseases.html\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">infectious agents</a> (such as viruses) or <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000816.htm\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">autoimmunity</a> may play a role in the development of the condition.
