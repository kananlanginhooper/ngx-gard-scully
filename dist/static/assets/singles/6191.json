In these cases, the cause of conversion disorder is unknown.[13716] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nResearch into the cause of conversion disorder has found that the brain imaging of some individuals with the disorder shows increased or reduced blood flow to certain areas of the brain.[13717] If areas of the brain that are responsible for communication with other body parts have reduced blood flow, this may cause neurological symptoms associated with conversion disorder. It is possible that these changes in blood flow may be caused by the brain receiving information about physical or emotional stressors.[13719] Regardless of the cause of the disorder, it is important to remember that the symptoms are very real; affected individuals are not faking symptoms of the disorder.[13718]<br />","dateModified":"2017-08-18T14:47:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":2557,"authors":"Berger FK, Zieve D, and Conaway B","articleTitle":"Conversion disorder","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"MedlinePlus","date":"November 18, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000954.htm","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":2559,"authors":"Marshall SA, Landau ME, Carroll CG, Schwieters B, and Llewellyn A","articleTitle":"Conversion disorders","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"November 9, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/287464-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13716,"authors":"Vermeulen M and Willems MH","articleTitle":"Conversion disorder: from DSM IV to DSM 5 or from a psychiatric to a neurological diagnosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Tijdschrift Voor Psychiatrie","date":"2015","volume":"57(8)","pages":"569-576","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26402892","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13717,"authors":"Gurses N, Temucin CM, Lay Ergun E, Ertugrul A, Ozer S, and Demir B","articleTitle":"Evoked potentials and regional cerebral blood flow changes in conversion disorder: a case report and review","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Turkish Journal of Psychiatry","date":"Spring 2008","volume":"19(1)","pages":"101-107","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18330748","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13718,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Conversion disorder","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Organization for Rare Disorders","date":"2003","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/conversion-disorder/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13719,"authors":"Owens C and Dein S","articleTitle":"Conversion disorder: the modern hysteria","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Advances in Psychiatric Treatment","date":"2006","volume":"12","pages":"152-157","url":"http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/aptrcpsych/12/2/152.full.pdf","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":12126,"questionText":"Is conversion disorder inherited?","answerText":"It is not thought that there is a single <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/gene\">gene</a> responsible for the development of conversion disorder.
