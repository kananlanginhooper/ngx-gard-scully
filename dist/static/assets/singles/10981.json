A hallmark of HDLS is leukoencephalopathy, which is damage to a type of brain tissue called <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002344.htm\" target=_blank>white matter</a>.&nbsp;Another common finding is axon damage due to swellings called spheroids. Damage to <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002261.htm\" target=_blank>myelin</a> and axons is thought to contribute to many of the neurological signs and symptoms seen in people with this condition, including the personality changes, loss of memory,&nbsp;changes in motor skills&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000739.htm\">dementia</a>.

Also common in HDLS are swellings called spheroids in the axons of the brain, which are a sign of axon damage. This damage is thought to contribute to the symptoms see in this condition, including personality changes (including a loss of social inhibitions and depression which&nbsp;are among the earliest symptoms of HDLS), memory loss and loss of executive function (the ability to plan and implement actions and develop problem-solving strategies which impairs skills such as impulse control, self-monitoring, and focusing attention appropriately). Some people with HDLS have mild seizures early in the disease and may experience a severe decline in thinking and reasoning abilities (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000739.htm\" target=_blank>dementia</a>) as the disease progresses. Over time, motor skills are affected, and people with HDLS may have difficulty walking. Many develop a pattern of movement abnormalities known as parkinsonism, which includes unusually slow movement (<a href=\"http://www.wemove.org/bradykinesia/bra.html\" target=_blank>bradykinesia</a>), involuntary trembling (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003192.htm\" target=_blank>tremor</a>), and muscle stiffness (rigidity).

This gene provides instructions for making a protein called colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1 receptor), which is found in the outer membrane of certain types of cells. The CSF-1 receptor triggers signaling pathways that control many important cellular processes, such as cell growth and division (proliferation) and maturation of the cell to take on defined functions (differentiation). Mutations in the <em>CSF1R</em> gene lead to a altered CSF-1 receptor protein which is unable to stimulate cell signaling pathways.
