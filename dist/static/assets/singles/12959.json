The autonomic nervous system is the part of the nervous system that regulates certain involuntary body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and bowel and bladder control. Orthostatic hypotension is a form of low blood pressure that happens when standing-up from sitting or lying down. Common symptoms may include dizziness, lightheadedness, generalized weakness, leg buckling, nausea, blurry vision, fatigue, and headaches. Additional symptoms can include chest pain (angina), head and neck pain (often affecting neck and shoulders with a coat hanger distribution), decline in cognitive functioning such as difficulty concentrating, temporary loss of consciousness or &ldquo;blackout&rdquo;.
