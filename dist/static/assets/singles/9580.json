Many experts consider it a variant of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000496.htm\" target=\"_blank\">minimal change disease</a>, but some experts believe it is a separate condition. It may present with <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000490.htm\" target=\"_blank\">nephrotic syndrome</a>, which is a group of symptoms that include protein in the urine (proteinuria), low blood protein levels, high cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, and swelling. It can also present with blood in the urine (hematuria).[13573] MPGN is characterized by an increased number of mesangial cells in the glomeruli in the kidneys and damage to the glomeruli. Glomeruli are the structures that help filter wastes and fluids.
