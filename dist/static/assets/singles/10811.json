Symptoms usually develop within the first few months of life and may include recurrent fevers and purple colored spots on the skin particularly around the eyes. Loss of body fat, bone, and joint pain also usually occur.&nbsp;Since so few people have been reported with CANDLE syndrome, it is difficult to know how it affects people in the long term. CANDLE syndrome occurs when the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PSMB8\" target=\"_blank\">PSMB8</a></em> gene is not working correctly. Other genes associated with CANDLE syndrome include <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PSMB4\" target=\"_blank\">PSMB4</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5684\" target=\"_blank\">PSMA3</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/POMP\" target=\"_blank\">POMP</a></em>.&nbsp; It is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern; however, when associated with variants in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/POMP\" target=\"_blank\">POMP</a></em> gene, may be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.
