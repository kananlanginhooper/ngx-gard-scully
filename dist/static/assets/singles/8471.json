Males are more commonly affected than females. This is because males have only one X chromosome and therefore one copy of the <em>GPR143 </em>gene. Females have two X chromosomes and therefore two copies of the <em>GPR143 </em>gene. If females have a mutation in one of their <em>GPR143 </em>genes, they still have a second normal <em>GPR143 </em>gene to compensate.
