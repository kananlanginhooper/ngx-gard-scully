Reducing the activity of T cells when appropriate prevents the overproduction of immune proteins called cytokines that lead to inflammation and can, when present in large quantities, can cause tissue damage. Researchers believe that variations in the <em>ITPKC</em> gene may interfere with the body's ability to reduce T cell activity, leading to inflammation that damages blood vessels and results in the symptoms of this disease.&nbsp;It is likely that other factors, including changes in additional genes, also influence the development of this complex disorder.[10560]","dateModified":"2016-02-03T19:42:00","references":[{"referenceId":10560,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Kawasaki disease","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"September 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/kawasaki-disease","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":10077,"questionText":"How is Kawasaki disease inherited?","answerText":"A susceptibility to Kawasaki disease (KD) appears to be passed through generations in families, but the inheritance pattern is unknown.

While neurologic complications or symptoms may occur in a small number of patients with Kawasaki disease, the vast majority escape serious central nervous system damage and data suggests that milder central nervous system effects, in the form of cognitive and academic difficulties are rare.[683] In some cases, however, Kawasaki disease can be associated with significant behavioral symptoms.[684]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA study conducted in 2000 by WJ King et al. found that cognitive development and academic performance were not significantly affected by Kawasaki disease. This study did find, however that individuals who had previous Kawasaki disease experienced significantly more behavior problems than their healthy siblings. These problems were predominantly internalizing and reflected a cluster of specific difficulties including somatic complaints, anxious-depressed behavior, and social problems. These children were also rated as having significantly more attention difficulties than their healthy siblings. A large proportion of parents in this study also perceived that the episode of Kawasaki disease had a long-lasting effect on their child, although this perception was often vague and was not related to the increased risk of behavior problems.[683] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe reported behavioral difficulties may be due to residual central nervous system effects of the disease process, the experience of an acute illness and hospitalization, and/or continued family anxiety after the illness. Heightened parental anxieties about children who have completely recovered from an illness can lead to overprotective relationships that may contribute to difficulties in the psychological development of their children.[683]","dateModified":"2013-07-05T15:42:00","references":[{"referenceId":683,"authors":"King JW, Schlieper A, Birdi N, Cappelli M, Korneluk Y, Rowe PC","articleTitle":"","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med","date":"May 2000","url":"http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/154/5/463","dateAccessed":"2008-10-03T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":684,"authors":"Carlton-Conway D, Ahluwalia R, Henry L, Michie C, Wood L, Tulloh R","articleTitle":"","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"BMC Pediatr","date":"2005","url":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=15916701","dateAccessed":"2008-10-03T00:00:00"}]},{"questionId":1147,"questionText":"Are there resources where I can connect with other parents whose child has developmental or behavior issues following Kawasaki disease?","answerText":"Yes.
