Likewise, it appears MS is often not included in the main differential diagnoses for SCA3.[12122][12121][12125][12129][12130] However, both conditions can cause ataxia and other neurological symptoms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe presence or absence of other neurologic or systemic problems can often help to differentiate between causes of ataxia.[12127] Therefore, evaluation by an experienced neurologist would be needed to make a correct diagnosis.&nbsp;Many physicians fail to pursue further diagnostic testing when a patient is labeled as having MS. But, there are several features that should prompt a physician to explore other disorders, including having a family history of neurologic disease (such as SCA3).[12128] Obtaining a second opinion may be useful.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are no specific tests for making a diagnosis of MS. The diagnosis often relies on a complete neurological exam, medical history, and ruling out other conditions that might cause similar signs and symptoms.[12124]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA diagnosis of SCA3, on the other hand, is based on the use of <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/testing/genetictesting\" target=\"_blank\">molecular genetic testing</a> to detect a specific type of mutation (<a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/group/hopes/cgi-bin/hopes_test/trinucleotide-repeat-disorders/#sca3-spinocerebellar-ataxia-type-3-or-machado-joseph-disease\" target=\"_blank\">CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion</a>) in a gene called <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/spinocerebellar-ataxia-type-3\" target=\"_blank\">ATXN3</a></em>. Genetic testing for SCA3 detects 100% of people with SCA3.[12121] Therefore, when SCA3 is suspected, genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis.[12126] If the disease-causing mutation in a family is known, genetic testing may also be considered for at-risk, adult family members without symptoms.[12121]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople who are concerned about a possible diagnosis of SCA3 are encouraged to speak with an experienced neurologist and/or a genetics professional regarding their questions and concerns.","dateModified":"2016-08-31T10:43:00","references":[{"referenceId":12121,"authors":"Henry Paulson","articleTitle":"Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"September 24, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1196/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12122,"authors":"Olaf Stüve and Jorge Oksenberg","articleTitle":"Multiple Sclerosis Overview","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"May 11, 2010","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1316/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12124,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Multiple Sclerosis - Diagnosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Mayo Clinic","date":"October 1, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/diagnosis-treatment/diagnosis/dxc-20131901","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12125,"authors":"Christopher Luzzio","articleTitle":"Multiple Sclerosis Differential Diagnoses","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"June 16, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1146199-differential","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12126,"authors":"","articleTitle":"FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT...
