Most people have two sex chromosomes, with girls having two X chromosomes, and boys having one X and one Y chromosome.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoys with 47, XYY syndrome have one X chromosome and two Y chromosomes in each cell of the body.

When a sperm that has two Y chromosomes fertilizes an egg (which has an X chromosome), the resulting baby will be a male with two Y chromosomes and one X chromosome.[3368] It is also possible that a similar random event could occur very early in an embryo&rsquo;s development.

Most people have two sex chromosomes, with girls having two X chromosomes, and boys having one X and one Y chromosome.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoys with 47, XYY syndrome have one X chromosome and two Y chromosomes in each cell of the body. This typically happens due to a random event when a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/19471.htm\">sperm cell</a> is formed that causes the sperm cell to have two Y chromosomes. When a sperm that has two Y chromosomes fertilizes an egg (which has an X chromosome), the resulting baby will be a male with two Y chromosomes and one X chromosome.[3368] It is also possible that a similar random event could occur very early in an embryo&rsquo;s development. This can produce a boy who has some cells that have two sex chromosomes and some cells that have an extra Y chromosome.[3368]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is not fully understood why an extra copy of the Y chromosome causes the features associated with 47, XYY syndrome. It is thought that the tall stature seen in some males with the syndrome is caused by having an extra copy of a <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/gene\">gene</a> that is located on the sex chromosomes called the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SHOX\"><em>SHOX</em></a><em> </em>gene. This gene provides instructions to the body to control growth of the bones. People who have an extra copy of the Y chromosome also have an extra copy of the <em>SHOX </em>gene, which could explain why they may be taller than expected. Another gene that is thought to cause the signs and symptoms of 47, XYY syndrome is called <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/22829\"><em>NLGN4Y</em></a><span><em>. </em></span><span>This gene is located on the Y chromosome and provides instructions to the body that helps form connections between the cells in the brain. It is thought that having an extra copy of this gene may cause the learning problems associated with 47, XYY syndrome.[11226]</span>","dateModified":"2018-01-14T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":3368,"authors":"","articleTitle":"47,XYY syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"January 2009","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/47xyy-syndrome","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11226,"authors":"Ross J and Bishop D","articleTitle":"XYY","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Unique","date":"2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.rarechromo.org/information/Chromosome_Y/XYY%20FTNW.pdf","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":2567,"questionText":"How can I find a genetics professional in my area?","answerText":"To find a medical professional who specializes in genetics, you can ask your doctor for a referral or you can search for one yourself.
