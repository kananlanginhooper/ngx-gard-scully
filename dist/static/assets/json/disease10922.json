The condition is extremely rare with only a handful of cases reported in the medical literature. Signs and symptoms associated with these cases include severe intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, normal to tall stature, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003165.htm\" target=\"_blank\">gynecomastia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001195.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypogonadism</a>, and behavioral abnormalities. 49, XXXYY syndrome is likely caused by a mistake (called <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/inheritance/chromosomalinheritance\" target=\"_blank\">nondisjunction</a>) that occurs at conception or during the formation of the sperm and/or egg.
