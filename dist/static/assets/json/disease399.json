More specifically, people with this condition have male external genitalia, ranging from normal to <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003269.htm\" target=\"_blank\">ambiguous</a>. Other common signs and symptoms include small testes, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003165.htm\" target=\"_blank\">gynecomastia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001191.htm\" target=\"_blank\">infertility</a> due to azoospermia (lack of sperm), and health problems related to low testosterone. Less often, affected people may experience abnormalities such as undescended testes and <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001286.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypospadias</a>. Gender role and gender identity are normally reported as male.[9923][9924] This condition may occur if the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SRY\" target=\"_blank\">SRY</a></em> gene (which is usually found on the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/Y\" target=\"_blank\">Y chromosome</a>) is misplaced onto the X chromosome.
