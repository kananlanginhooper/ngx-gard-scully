The condition may affect one or both legs. Some cases are isolated birth defects, while others are associated with a variety of skeletal and other malformations.[10758][10759] It can also be a part of a recognized syndrome such as <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/7885/werners-syndrome/resources/1\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">Werner's syndrome</a>, tibial hemimelia-polysyndactyly-triphalangeal thumb syndrome, and <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/29/charge-syndrome/resources/1\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">CHARGE syndrome</a>.
