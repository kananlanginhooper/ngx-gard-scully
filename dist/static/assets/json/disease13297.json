Signs and symptoms can vary widely among people with this syndrome. More common signs and symptoms include abnormalities of the kidneys or urinary tract, a form of diabetes called <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/diabetes/maturity-onset-diabetes-of-the-young-mody\" target=\"_blank\">maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5</a> (MODY5), and mildly distinctive facial features. Other signs and symptoms may include developmental delay, intellectual disability, and&nbsp;behavioral or psychiatric disorders. Some people with 17q12 deletion syndrome have seizures, and/or abnormalities of the eyes, liver, brain, genitalia, or other body systems.[14685][14686]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n17q12 deletion syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; however, in most people with this syndrome, the deletion is not inherited from a parent and occurs sporadically. Less commonly, a person with 17q12 deletion syndrome  inherits the deletion from a parent. Children of a person with the deletion have a 50% chance of inheriting the deletion.[14685][14686]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment depends on the specific signs and symptoms in each person. Even in the absence of structural abnormalities of the kidneys, they should continue to be monitored for problems that may arise.[14686]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2018-05-31T12:32:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":10972,"relatedDiseaseName":"Chromosome 17q deletion","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":681,"dateCreated":"2020-11-30T12:27:00","publishDate":"2020-12-01T00:00:00","title":"NORD RareLaunch® Workshops","description":"The National Organization for Rare Disorders is hosting&nbsp;RareLaunch&reg; Workshops on December 2 and 3.
