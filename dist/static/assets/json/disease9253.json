Specifically, a thin membrane called the septum pellucidum is missing from its normal position in the middle of the brain.[12623] When it is missing, symptoms may include learning difficulties, behavioral changes, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/seizures.html\">seizures</a>, and changes in vision. Absence of the septum pellucidum is not typically seen as an isolated finding. Instead, absence of the septum pellucidum is associated with other conditions such as <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7627/septo-optic-dysplasia\">septo-optic dysplasia</a>.[12624] Treatment options for the condition vary depending on the underlying disorder. Diagnosis of absence of the septum pellucidum can be made through imaging such as an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/mriscans.html\">MRI.</a> Symptoms of absence of the septum pellucidum typically present during childhood, but a diagnosis can also be made before an individual is born (prenatally).[12625] If an individual is found to be missing the septum pellucidum, a search for &nbsp;an underlying disorder should be made.<br />","dateModified":"2016-11-19T11:28:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":11342,"questionText":"What are the symptoms of absence of the septum pellucidum?","answerText":"The symptoms of absence of the septum pellucidum may vary, and it may be difficult to determine which symptoms are due to &nbsp;the &nbsp;underlying disorder and which ones are due to absence of the septum pellucidum.&nbsp; Symptoms that are common among people with absence of the septum pellucidum include learning disabilities, seizures, and behavioral changes. The septum pellucidum provides information to the rest of the body about how the body is doing. This information may include whether or not the body has received enough sleep or food, or whether the environment is safe.[12626] Therefore, an absence of the septum pellucidum may cause an individual to feel hungry even when they are not or tired when they have had enough sleep. Some people with absence of the septum pellucidum do not grow very tall or have a high <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/\">body mass index</a> (BMI). This means that they have a higher weight than is typical for their height.[12627]<br />","dateModified":"2016-11-19T11:38:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":12626,"authors":"M Sarwar","articleTitle":"The Septum Pellucidum: Normal and Abnormal","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"American Journal of Neuroradiology","date":"October 1989","volume":"10","pages":"989-1005","url":"http://www.ajnr.org/content/10/5/989.full.pdf","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12627,"authors":"C Traggiai and R Stanhope","articleTitle":"Body mass index and hypothalamic morphology on MRI in children with congenital midline cerebral abnormalities","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism","date":"February 2004","volume":"17(2)","pages":"219-221","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15055357","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":11343,"questionText":"What causes absence of the septum pellucidum?","answerText":"Absence of the septum pellucidum can be caused by multiple factors depending on the underlying condition.

Absence of the septum pellucidum can also be the result of a genetic condition that is present in a baby at birth. Additionally, the septum pellucidum is connected to another brain structure called the <a href=\"https://radiopaedia.org/articles/corpus-callosum\">corpus callosum</a>, which is responsible for sending information between the two halves of the brain.
