The major types of this disorder are called D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA), L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (L-2-HGA), and combined D,L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D,L-2-HGA). The main features of D-2-HGA vary within the different types but, in general, may&nbsp;include delayed development; seizures; weak muscle tone (hypotonia); and abnormalities in the largest part of the brain (the cerebrum), which controls many important functions such as muscle movement, speech, vision, thinking, emotion, and memory. The different types  and subtypes are caused by different <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/basics/gene\" target=\"_blank\">gene </a><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> and are inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>&nbsp;pattern, except for a D-2HGA subtype, known as type II D-2-HGA, which is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>&nbsp;pattern.[9364] There is no cure yet.

However, for the D,L-2HGA type (combined type) some researches had used either malate or citrate. During malate treatment, urinary malate concentration increased, but beyond that, no effects were observed. In contrast, treatment with citrate led to some good results, but more studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this treatment.[9365]","dateModified":"2017-04-07T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":9365,"authors":"Mühlhausen C, Salomons GS, Lukacs Z, Struys EA, van der Knaap MS, Ullrich K & Santer R","articleTitle":"Combined D2-/L2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (SLC25A1 deficiency): clinical course and effects of citrate treatment","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Inherit Metab Dis","date":"September, 2014","volume":"37(5)","pages":"775-81","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24687295","dateAccessed":"2015-07-22T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":5661,"relatedDiseaseName":"D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":10472,"relatedDiseaseName":"L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":681,"dateCreated":"2020-11-30T12:27:00","publishDate":"2020-12-01T00:00:00","title":"NORD RareLaunch® Workshops","description":"The National Organization for Rare Disorders is hosting&nbsp;RareLaunch&reg; Workshops on December 2 and 3.
