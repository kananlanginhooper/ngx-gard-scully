The deletion occurs near the end of the long arm (or q arm) of the chromosome at a location designated as q13.3. Not everyone with 22q13.3 deletion syndrome will have the same medical, developmental, or behavioral problems (features).&nbsp;Common problems include low muscle tone (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003298.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypotonia</a>), <a href=\"http://nichcy.org/disability/specific/intellectual\" target=\"_blank\">intellectual disability</a>, developmental delays especially&nbsp;<a href=\"https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/not-talk.html\" target=\"_blank\">delayed or absent speech</a>,  and tendency to overheat. Children may be tall and thin. Differences in other physical features are usually mild and may include long eyelashes, down slanting eyes, large ears, ears without normal folding, bulb-like tip of nose, pointed chin, large hands, and toenails that flake off as infants and then become hard and brittle as age.  Additional medical problems may include gastrointestinal problems such as chronic <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/diarrhea.html\" target=\"_blank\">diarrhea</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/constipation.html\" target=\"_blank\">constipation</a>, or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/gerd.html\" target=\"_blank\">gastroesophageal reflux</a>, seizures, delayed <a href=\"https://www.understood.org/en/learning-attention-issues/child-learning-disabilities/movement-coordination-issues/all-about-fine-motor-skills\" target=\"_blank\">fine motor skills</a>, changes in the way the brain developed, kidney problems especially <a href=\"https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/vesicoureteral-reflux.html\" target=\"_blank\">vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)</a>, vision problems such as <a href=\"https://www.aapos.org/terms/conditions/100\" target=\"_blank\">strabismus,</a>&nbsp;swelling of arms or legs (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/lymphedema.html\" target=\"_blank\">lymphedema</a>)&nbsp;during teen years, and recurrent infections, especially <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/earinfections.html\" target=\"_blank\">ear infections</a>. Unusual behaviors may include mouthing or chewing on non-food items, decreased perception of pain, and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/autism.html\" target=\"_blank\">autistic</a>-like behaviors such as flapping of hands and repetitive motions.[750][14641][14681]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost reported cases of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome are caused by 22q13.3 deletions, which usually includes many genes. The loss or the variation (mutation) of a particular <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a> on chromosome 22, called the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene=shank3\" target=\"_blank\"><em>SHANK3</em></a>&nbsp;gene, is likely responsible for many of the common features associated with 22q13.3 deletion&nbsp;syndrome, especially intellectual disability, speech problems, low muscle tone, and developmental delay. Additional genes within the deleted area probably contribute to other features of the syndrome.[750][14641] In most cases, a larger deletion increases the number and severity of associated features, especially&nbsp; the severity of low muscle tone, developmental delay, differences in physical features, speech, and autism-like behavior. Smaller deletions located closer to the tip of the 22q seem to be associated with fewer medical, developmental, and behavioral problems.[14641]","dateModified":"2018-05-16T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":681,"dateCreated":"2020-11-30T12:27:00","publishDate":"2020-12-01T00:00:00","title":"NORD RareLaunchÂ® Workshops","description":"The National Organization for Rare Disorders is hosting&nbsp;RareLaunch&reg; Workshops on December 2 and 3.
