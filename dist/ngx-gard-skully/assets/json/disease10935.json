In most cases, parents do not have any chromosomal anomaly.[10593] However, sometimes one parent has a <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/structuralchanges\" target=\"_blank\">balanced translocation</a> where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause any signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having an affected child with a chromosomal anomaly like a microdeletion.
