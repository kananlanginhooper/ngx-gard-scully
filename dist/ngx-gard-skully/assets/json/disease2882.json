Infants with achondrogenesis usually have a small body, extremely short arms and legs, other skeletal abnormalities, and underdeveloped lungs.[2631][15002] There are at least three forms of achondrogenesis, type 1A, type 1B and type 2. Achondrogenesis is usually diagnosed during pregnancy by ultrasound and genetic testing is used to distinguish between the three types.[2631][15002] Type 1A and 1B achondrogenesis are both inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>&nbsp;pattern.

Germline mosaicism occurs then a person's reproductive cells (sperm or egg) carry a mutation not found in the rest of the cells in the body. Somatic mosaicism occurs when a person has a some body cells that carry a mutation and some body cells that do not carry the mutation.
