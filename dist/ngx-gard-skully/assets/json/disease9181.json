They may occur at any age, but are most common in men between 50 and 80 years of age. Many people with an AAA have no symptoms, but some people have a pulsing sensation in the abdomen and/or pain in the back.[7209] If the aneurysm ruptures, it may cause deep, severe pain; nausea; vomiting; fast heart rate; clammy skin; and/or shock.[7209][909] About 20% of AAAs eventually rupture and are often fatal.[7209] The condition has multiple genetic and environmental risk factors, and may sometimes occur as part of an inherited syndrome. When more than one family member is affected, it may be considered \"familial abdominal aortic aneurysm.\"[7210] Treatment depends on the size of the aneurysm and may include blood pressure medications, or surgery to repair the aneurysm.[7209]","dateModified":"2014-02-25T11:05:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":7327,"questionText":"Is abdominal aortic aneurysm inherited?","answerText":"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is thought to be a <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/complexdisorders\" target=\"_blank\">multifactorial condition</a>, meaning that one or more genes likely interact with environmental factors to cause the condition.
