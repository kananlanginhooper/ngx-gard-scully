Early symptoms of this condition include diarrhea, vomiting, and poor growth. Without treatment, later complications may include muscle weakness, poor night and color vision, tremors, and speech difficulties.[15463][15464]&nbsp; The long-term outcome can be difficult to predict. Abetalipoproteinemia is diagnosed based on clinical exam, laboratory tests showing abnormally low cholesterol, and confirmed by genetic testing.[15462] This condition is caused by genetic variants in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MTTP\" target=\"_blank\">MTTP</a></em> gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.[15466] This condition has been treated with a low fat diet and vitamin supplements.[15462] Most people with abetalipoproteinemia who are treated do not develop complications.[15466][15465]","dateModified":"2020-04-07T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":1714,"questionText":"What are the signs and&nbsp;symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia?","answerText":"The signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia usually appear in the first few months of life.[15462][15466] They can include:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>inability to absorb fats and some vitamins</li>\r\n    <li>poor growth in infancy</li>\r\n    <li>digestive symptoms such as diarrhea and steatorrhea (foul-smelling stools)</li>\r\n    <li>abnormal, star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis)\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBecause abetalipoproteinemia is extremely rare, the course of the disease is difficult to predict.
