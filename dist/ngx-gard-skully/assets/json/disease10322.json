This enzyme assists in the processing of a particular <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary.cfm?key=amino%20acids\" target=\"_blank\">amino acid</a> called isoleucine.&nbsp;The inability to process&nbsp;isoleucine correctly leads to the buildup of the amino acid in the body.&nbsp; The buildup can cause a variety of health problems, which vary widely from severe and life-threatening to mild or absent.&nbsp; Signs and symptoms of the disorder can begin a few days after birth or later in childhood. The initial symptoms often include poor feeding, lack of energy, vomiting, and irritability. These symptoms sometimes progress to serious medical problems such as difficulty breathing, seizures, and coma.[591][[11322] This condition is caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ACADSB\" target=\"_blank\">ACADSB</a></em> gene.

High protein foods (like milk and daily products, meat and poultry, fish, eggs, dried beans and legumes, nuts and peanut butter) should be avoided. Some vegetables and fruits have small amounts of protein; these should be carefully measured when included in the diet. Medical foods such as low-protein flours, pastas, and rice may be available.
