There are three types of 3BHSD deficiency - the salt-wasting form, non-salt-wasting form, and non-classic form. Signs and symptoms depend on the type of 3BHSD deficiency; the age at diagnosis; and the sex of the affected person. The salt-wasting form is the most severe type and can even be life-threatening. People with this form are generally diagnosed at birth due to symptoms related to abnormal salt reabsorption (i.e. dehydration, poor feeding, vomiting). Males with any form of the condition often have abnormalities of the external genitalia and are frequently <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/maleinfertility.html\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">infertile</a>.
