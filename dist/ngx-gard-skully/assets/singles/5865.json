An ASD is a hole in the wall (septum) between the two upper chambers of the heart (the atria). ASDs can be classified by location. An ostium secundum ASD is a hole in the center of the atrial septum.[11976]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNormally, the right side of the heart pumps oxygen-poor blood to the lungs, while the left side pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body. An ASD allows blood from both sides to mix, causing the heart to work less efficiently.[11978]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA small hole may not cause any symptoms or problems. A larger hole can eventually cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, respiratory infections, fainting, irregular heart rhythms or fatigue after mild activity.[11978][11977] Larger ASDs can also ultimately lead to <a href=\"http://www.phassociation.org/AboutPH\" target=\"_blank\">pulmonary artery hypertension</a>, right ventricular hypertrophy (enlargement); <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Arrhythmia/AboutArrhythmia/Tachycardia-Fast-Heart-Rate_UCM_302018_Article.jsp#.V6N4wPkrJD8\" target=\"_blank\">SVT</a>, or heart failure.[11976]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost cases of ASD are not inherited and occur by chance.
