The changes in brain development are present from birth (congenital). Dandy-Walker complex affects the formation of the area of the brain known as the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cerebellardisorders.html\">cerebellum</a>, which is responsible for coordinating movement, and the fluid-filled spaces around it. People with Dandy-Walker complex may have a portion of the brain called the <a href=\"https://radiopaedia.org/articles/vermis\">cerebellar vermis</a> that is smaller than expected (hypoplastic) or completely absent (aplastic). The cerebellar vermis is the area of the brain between the two halves of the cerebellum. <span>&nbsp;</span>People with Dandy-Walker complex have a larger than expected <a href=\"https://radiopaedia.org/articles/fourth-ventricle\">fourth ventricle</a> of the brain. This ventricle allows fluid to flow between the upper and lower areas of the brain and spinal cord. People with Dandy-Walker complex may have an enlarged portion of the base of the skull (posterior fossa).[4880][11708] Dandy-Walker complex may be more common in females than in males.[11708]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDandy-Walker complex is a group of disorders that have overlapping symptoms. These disorders include:[11708][5740]<br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\r\n    <li>Dandy-Walker malformation (also known as Dandy-Walker syndrome): having a small cerebellar vermis, large fourth ventricle, and enlarged posterior fossa</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://radiopaedia.org/articles/isolated-inferior-vermian-hypoplasia\">Isolated cerebellar vermis hypoplasia</a> (sometimes known as Dandy-Walker variant): having a small cerebellar vermis without other features of Dandy-Walker complex</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://radiopaedia.org/articles/mega-cisterna-magna-1\">Mega-cisterna magna</a>: having an enlarged posterior fossa with a typically developed cerebellum.

In order to provide families with more information about the specific developmental differences in the brain and the long-term outlook, a person with Dandy-Walker complex may be given a more specific diagnosis.[11708] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, Dandy-Walker complex is caused by an underlying genetic change. These genetic changes may cause Dandy-Walker complex alone, or they may cause Dandy-Walker complex as well as other health problems. In these situations, the complex can run in families. However, in most situations, Dandy-Walker complex is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.[11708] Dandy-Walker complex can be diagnosed by imaging of the brain such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ultrasound.html\">ultrasound</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ctscans.html\">CT scan</a>, or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/mriscans.html\">MRI scan</a>.[11708][5740] Treatment options may include a surgery to place a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003019.htm\">ventriculoperitoneal shunt</a> that relieves excess fluid from the brain, as well as <a href=\"https://www.wcpt.org/what-is-physical-therapy\">physical</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aota.org/Conference-Events/OTMonth/what-is-OT.aspx\">occupational therapies</a>.[4880][11708]","dateModified":"2018-04-30T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":12789,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Dandy-Walker complex?","answerText":"The signs and symptoms of Dandy-Walker complex may depend on the age of the person who has the complex.

In other cases, the first symptoms of the complex begin in infancy. Symptoms of Dandy-Walker complex that begin in infancy may include a head circumference that is becoming larger faster than expected, low muscle tone (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003298.htm\">hypotonia</a>) or very stiff muscles (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003297.htm\">spasticity</a>).
