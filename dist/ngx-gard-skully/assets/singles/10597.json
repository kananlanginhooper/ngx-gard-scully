People with this condition are genetically male (one X and one Y chromosome) but do not respond to male hormones at all. As a result, they generally have normal female external genitalia and female breasts. However, they do not have a uterus or cervix so are unable to menstruate or conceive children. Other signs and symptoms may include undescended testes and sparse to absent pubic hair. Gender identity is typically female. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome is caused by changes (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>) in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/AR\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">AR</a> gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=209\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked</a> manner. Treatment and gender assignment can be a very complex issue, and must be individualized with each affected person. In general, surgery may be required to remove testes that are located in unusual places and estrogen replacement therapy can be prescribed after puberty.[10036][10037][10038]","dateModified":"2015-11-18T15:51:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
