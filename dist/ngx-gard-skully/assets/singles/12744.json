CIPO can occur in people of any age. It may be primary or secondary. Primary or idiopathic (where the cause is unknown) CIPO occurs by itself. Secondary CIPO develops as a complication of another medical condition. In some people with CIPO, the condition is caused by variations (mutations) affecting the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FLNA\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FLNA</em></a>&nbsp;or <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ACTG2\" target=\"_blank\">ACTG2</a></em> gene. Before making the diagnosis other conditions with similar symptoms should be ruled out.[10041][10042][10043]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment aims to restore the normal bowel movements and to correct nutritional deficiencies. Treatment may include antibiotics, prokinetic medications (metoclopramide, cisapride), surgical excision of intestinal segments in cases of localized disease, and parenteral nutrition. Intestinal transplantation has been successful in some cases. Several specialists may be needed for better management of the disease.[14503]","dateModified":"2018-03-28T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12743,"relatedDiseaseName":"ACTG2-related disorders ","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
