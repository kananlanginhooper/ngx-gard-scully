People with behavior changes may have disinhibition (with socially inappropriate behavior), apathy and loss of empathy, hyperorality (eating excessive amounts of food or attempting to consume inedible things), agitation, compulsive behavior, and various other changes.[1251][14857] Examples of problems with language include difficulty speaking or understanding speech.[1251] Some people with FTD also develop a motor syndrome such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000759.htm\" target=\"_blank\">parkinsonism</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Motor-Neuron-Diseases-Fact-Sheet\" target=\"_blank\">motor neuron disease</a>&nbsp;(which may be associated with various additional symptoms).[14857]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is a strong genetic component to  FTDs.[1251][14857] It sometimes follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, or sometimes there is a general family history of dementia or psychiatric disorders.[14857] The three main genes responsible for familial FTD are <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MAPT\" target=\"_blank\">MAPT</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GRN\" target=\"_blank\">GRN</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/C9orf72\" target=\"_blank\">C9orf72</a></em>. However, the genetic cause of familial FTD cannot always be identified.[14857]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile there are currently no treatments to slow or stop the progression of the disease, some of the symptoms can be managed.[11795] Treatment of symptoms may involve behavior modification, or medications for symptoms such as aggressiveness, agitation, or dangerous behaviors. Anti-depressants have been shown to improve some symptoms.[1251] Involving a team of specialists can help ensure that the challenges of the disease are properly addressed.[11795] Unfortunately, the outlook for people with FTD is poor, as the disease often progresses rapidly. However, the outlook does vary, with the disease course ranging from less than 2 years in some people, to more than 10 years in others.[1251]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough the name and classification of FTD has been a topic of discussion for over a century, the current classification considers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/7392/pick-disease-of-the-brain/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">Pick&rsquo;s disease</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/8541/primary-progressive-aphasia/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">primary progressive aphasia</a>, and <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10792/semantic-dementia/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">semantic dementia</a> as sub-types of FTD.[1251]","dateModified":"2018-08-06T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":7392,"relatedDiseaseName":"Behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":8541,"relatedDiseaseName":"Primary progressive aphasia","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":10792,"relatedDiseaseName":"Semantic dementia","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
