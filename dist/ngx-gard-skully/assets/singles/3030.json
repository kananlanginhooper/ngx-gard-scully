The lungs and spine may also be affected. As the name suggests, most commonly, one or both kneecaps of a person with SPS may be very small (hypoplastic) or completely absent (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002233.htm\">aplastic</a>). This can cause pain in the knee, wearing down of the soft tissues surrounding the knee (<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/arthrosis-vs-arthritis\">arthrosis</a>), and frequent <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001070.htm\">kneecap dislocations</a>.

While the exact role of the <em>TBX4 </em>gene in humans is not known, it is known that a very similar gene exists in chickens and mice and helps their hind legs develop properly. Therefore, it is thought that the protein made from the <em>TBX4</em> gene is involved in the development of the legs, but researchers are still trying to understand how changes in the TBX4 gene cause all of the features seen in a person with SPS, as well as why changes in the gene may affect people differently.[14607]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2018-05-06T12:05:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":14607,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Ischiocoxopodopatellar Syndrome; ICPPS","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man","date":"January 29, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.omim.org/entry/147891","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":12804,"questionText":"How is small patella syndrome (SPS) inherited?","answerText":"Small patella syndrome (SPS) is inherited in an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002049.htm\">autosomal dominant</a> manner.

One copy of each gene comes from the mother and one from the father. Since SPS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, people with SPS need to have a genetic change (pathogenic variant or <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\">mutation</a>) in only one copy of the <em>TBX4</em> gene in each cell of the body to have SPS.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen a person with SPS has children, each child has a:<br />\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\r\n    <li>50% chance to inherit the pathogenic variant in the <em>TBX4</em> gene, meaning he or she will have SPS</li>\r\n    <li>50% chance to inherit the working copy of <em>TBX4</em>, meaning he or she will not have SPS</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSPS shows a trait called <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/inheritance/penetranceexpressivity\">variable expressivity</a>.

For example, some people with SPS may not notice that they have a small kneecap, while others may have pain or frequent dislocations of the knee.[14603]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, a person with SPS may be the first person diagnosed with the syndrome in their family. This could happen for two reasons. First, it may be that the newly diagnosed person is the first person in the family to have a pathogenic variant in the <em>TBX4</em> gene. This is called a <em>de novo</em> mutation. In other cases, a person with SPS is the first person diagnosed in the family, but there are other affected family members that were not diagnosed because they only had very mild changes in the size of their kneecaps and other bones.[14609]","dateModified":"2018-05-06T12:07:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[{"referenceId":14603,"authors":"Lacombe D","articleTitle":"Coxopodopatellar syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet","date":"November 2006","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=en&Expert=1509","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14609,"authors":"Kerstjens-Frederikse WS, Bongers EM, Roofthooft MT, Leter EM, Douwes JM, Van Dijk A, Vonk-Noordegraaf A, Dijk-Bos KK, Hoefsloot LH, Hoendermis ES, Gille JJ, Sikkema-Raddatz B, Hofstra RM, and Berger RM","articleTitle":"TBX4 mutations (small patella syndrome) are associated with childhood-onset pulmonary arterial hypertension","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Journal of Medical Genetics","date":"August 2013","volume":"50(8)","pages":"500-506","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3717587/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":12805,"questionText":"How is small patella syndrome (SPS) diagnosed?","answerText":"Small patella syndrome (SPS) is suspected when a doctor notices features of the syndrome during a physical exam such as a small or missing kneecap or one leg being shorter than the other.
