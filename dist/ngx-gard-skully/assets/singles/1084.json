This can result in dangerously low blood pressure (hypotension), <a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/166724-overview\" target=\"_blank\">hypoalbuminemia</a>, and a decrease in plasma volume (<a href=\"http://c.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/hemoconcentration\" target=\"_blank\">hemoconcentration</a>).[3824][13029]&nbsp;Initial symptoms may include fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, extreme thirst, and sudden increase in body weight.

The severity also varies, and the condition can be fatal.[13029]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn many cases the cause is not known (idiopathic SCLS).[13029] Some people with SCLS report having had an infection (such as a virus) before the episode.[13653] Some cases of capillary leak are associated with various conditions of the heart, kidney, or liver.[13029] Treatment during an episode may involve stabilizing the airway and breathing, and infusion of fluids, medications, or blood products.
