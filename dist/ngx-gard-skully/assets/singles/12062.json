People with visual snow syndrome see many flickering tiny dots, like snow or static, that fill&nbsp;the entire visual field. Other visual symptoms include seeing blobs of varying size and shape (floaters) and continuing to see images after they are out of the line of sight. In addition, people with visual snow syndrome may have light sensitivity, difficulty with night vision,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/migraine.html\">migraines</a>, and ringing in the ears. The symptoms do not usually change over time. The&nbsp;cause of visual snow syndrome is unknown, but it is likely to be involve how the brain processes vision. Visual snow syndrome is diagnosed based on the symptoms.
