It is\r\ncharacterized by an enlarged, funnel-shaped cavity of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://teaching.pharmacy.umn.edu/courses/eyeAP/Eye_Anatomy/CoatsoftheEye/OpticDiscandNerve.htm\" target=\"_blank\">optic disc</a>, the point in the eye where the optic nerve fibers leave <a href=\"http://teaching.pharmacy.umn.edu/courses/eyeAP/Eye_Anatomy/CoatsoftheEye/OpticDiscandNerve.htm\" target=\"_blank\">the retina</a>. The disc is enlarged  and has a white center  (giving the appearance of a white pupil). &nbsp;The blood vessels are increased in number and curve as they come from the enlarged disc that have the white center, resulting in this malformation to be similar to petals on a flower. Most reported cases are unilateral\r\n(affecting only one eye), sporadic (without other cases in the family), and occur\r\nin females. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSymptoms include very poor vision in the affected eye with poor <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003396.htm\" target=\"_blank\">visual acuity</a>. MGS may occur by itself or along with other eye abnormalities, such as crossed eyes (strabismus) or lazy eye (amblyopia), or other non-ocular problems like brain disorders. [13744][13745][13746] Typically, individuals with non-ocular\r\n&nbsp;findings also have a wide head,\r\ndepressed nasal bridge, and mid upper lip defect or cleft.[13746] MGS seems to be\r\ncaused from failure of the optic nerve to completely form when the baby is developing. &nbsp;The most severe complication is <a href=\"https://nei.nih.gov/health/retinaldetach/retinaldetach\" target=\"_blank\">retinal detachment</a>, and can occur in about 26&ndash;38% of people with MGS.[13747] The MGS is sometimes misdiagnosed as an <a href=\"https://aapos.org/terms/conditions/35\" target=\"_blank\">optic nerve coloboma</a>.[13746]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment includes surgery and may result in\r\nsome recovery of vision. &nbsp;Depending\r\non the other associated abnormalities some patients require referrals to\r\nseveral specialties such as neurosurgery, interventional neuroradiology,\r\notolaryngology, and dentistry. All people diagnosed with morning glory disc anomaly should have brain image exams.[13746][13747]\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","dateModified":"2017-08-29T12:55:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
