Non-Hodgkins lymphoma involves abnormal growth of white blood cells, either T cells or B cells. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is an aggressive cancer that usually involves the T-cells. Cancer cells in ALCL can be identified by their appearance under the microscope and by the presence of a <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/diagnosis/tumor-markers-fact-sheet\" target=\"_blank\">tumor marker</a> called CD30 or Ki-1.[15160][15161]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are two types of ALCL, a type that affects mainly the skin (cutaneous ALCL) and a type that affects other body organs (systmic ALCL). Systemic ALCL also has two types, ALK-positive (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) and ALK-negative. ALK-positive ALCL occurs more often in children and young adults. ALK-negative ALCL tends to occur in older adults.[15161][15162]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe symptoms of cutaneous ALCL include red skin lesions that break open and do not heal. Sometimes cutaneous ALCL is also found in the lymph nodes. The symptoms of systemic ALCL include fever, night sweats, and weight loss (B symptoms). The cancer can be found in the bone, soft tissue, spleen, liver and skin. The cause of ALCL is unknown. One type of ALK-negative ALCL has been associated with breast implants.&nbsp; ALCL is diagnosed by a biopsy of the tumor or abnormal skin and examination of the tumor cells under a microscope. Additional testing including PET scans, CT scans, MRI and a bone marrow biopsy can tell doctors if the cancer has spread to other organs.[15060[15061]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nALCL is treated using chemotherapy, and a stem-cell transplant for people with more aggressive cancer or for ALCL that has come back. In addition, there are newer treatments that target the cancer cells directly and have been very effective. In general, ALK-positive ALCL has a better long-term outlook than ALK-negative ALCL.[15061][15062]<br />","dateModified":"2019-01-07T12:25:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":15160,"authors":"Shustov A, Soma L","articleTitle":"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma: Contemporary concepts and optimal management.","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Cancer Treat Res","date":"2019","volume":"176","pages":"127-144","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30596216","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15161,"authors":"Tsuyama N, Sakamoto K, Sakata S, Dobashi A, Takeuchi K","articleTitle":"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma: pathology, genetics and clinical aspects.","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Clin Exp Hematop","date":"2017","volume":"57(3)","pages":"120-142","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29279550","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15162,"authors":"Ferreri AJ, Govi S, Pileri SA, Savage KJ","articleTitle":"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK-negative","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Crit Rev Oncol Hematol","date":"2013","volume":"85(2)","pages":"206-215","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22789917","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":11955,"relatedDiseaseName":"Lymphoma","relation":"Parent","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":11955,"relatedDiseaseName":"Lymphoma","relation":"Parent","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":false}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
