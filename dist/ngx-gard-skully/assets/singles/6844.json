The signs and symptoms of the condition and the disease severity differ by type. Babies affected by early-onset (infantile) Krabbe disease, the most common and severe form of the condition, typically develop features in the first six months of life. Symptoms of infantile Krabbe disease may include irritability; <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000991.htm\" target=\"_blank\">failure to thrive</a>; slowed development; unexplained fevers; and progressive muscle weakness, hearing loss and vision loss. People affected by the late-onset forms may not develop symptoms until later in childhood, early adolescence or even into adulthood. Signs and symptoms of these forms are extremely variable but may include muscle weakness and rigidity; walking difficulties; vision loss; intellectual regression; and/or seizures.
