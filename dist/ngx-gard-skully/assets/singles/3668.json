Symptoms often start several days after a viral illness.[4556][14019][14020] Other symptoms include generalized muscle weakness and respiratory failure. The cause is not known, but it is thought to be an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/autoimmunediseases.html\">autoimmune disease</a> in which there are <a href=\"https://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/autoantibodies/\">autoantibodies</a> that attack the nerves. In most people with Miller Fisher syndrome an antibody (<a href=\"https://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/test-catalog/Clinical+and+Interpretive/58017\">anti-GQ1b</a>) is identified. The presence of these autoantibodies helps confirm the diagnosis of the syndrome.[14020] Treatment includes <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/immunoglobulin-therapy#1\">intravenous immunoglobulin</a> (IVIG), <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/transplant/programs/kidney/incompatible/plasmapheresis.html\">plasmapheresis</a> (a plasma exchange procedure in which the antibodies are removed from the blood) and supportive care. The prognosis is usually good, and in most cases, there is almost complete recovery within 6 months.[14020][14021] In rare cases, the syndrome may progress and permanent neurological deficits may be present.[14020][14021][14022]","dateModified":"2017-10-31T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
