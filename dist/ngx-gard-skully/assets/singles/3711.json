This is likely due to the small number of known cases of&nbsp;10q22.3q23.2 microdeletion syndrome, because, since MBL deficiency is relatively common, it would not be surprising to find another child, like your daughter, who had both.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat said however, when very detailed molecular mapping of various microdeletions in the 10q22-q24 region were performed, it was found that the deletions were very complicated and involved rearrangement of other chromosomal material.[11421][11422] Therefore it is difficult to state conclusively that there is no connection at the molecular level as our scientific understanding just is not to that level at this time.","dateModified":"2016-04-30T23:11:00","references":[{"referenceId":1534,"authors":"","articleTitle":"MBL2","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"March 2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene=mbl2","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":5226,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Mannose-binding lectin deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"March 2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11420,"authors":"Bronkhorst MW and Bouwman LH","articleTitle":"Mannose-binding lectin deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"July 13 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.uptodate.com/contents/mannose-binding-lectin-deficiency","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11421,"authors":"Balciuniene J, Feng N, Iyadurai K, et al","articleTitle":"Recurrent 10q22-q23 Deletions: A Genomic Disorder on 10q Associated with Cognitive and Behavioral Abnormalities","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"American Journal of Human Genetics","date":"2007","volume":"80(5)","pages":"938-947","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1852738/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11422,"authors":"Reddy KS, Mardach R, and Bass H","articleTitle":"Oligoarray (105K) CGH analysis of chromosome microdeletions within 10q22.1q24.32","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Cytogenet Genome Res","date":"2011","volume":"132(1-2)","pages":"113-120","url":"http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20714122","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":10603,"questionText":"Does mannose-binding lectin protein (MBL) deficiency increase the risk for autoimmune or other conditions?","answerText":"Again, this is a very difficult question to answer definitively.

Therefore medical researchers believe deficiency of MBL is likely further influenced by other genetic and environmental factors that are currently poorly understood.[3409]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany of the published studies of the effects of MBL deficiency have conflicting findings, with one study finding a increase in risk or severity associated with MBL, while another finds no effect or even a decreased risk.[11420][3409][11423][11424] Several authors have suggested this is because those who are defined as having MBL deficiency differs markedly between the studies.[11423][11424]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverall, however, there seems to be agreement that increased susceptibility to infection is generally seen in patients with MBL deficiency when additional factors that compromise the immune system are present.[11420][5226][3409][11423][11424]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince the MBL protein is involved in the inflammatory process, its deficiency has been studied in relation to autoimmune diseases.
