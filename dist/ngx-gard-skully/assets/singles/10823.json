Affected infants are usually a normal weight at birth, but they are constantly hungry, which leads to excessive feeding and weight gain during the first year and throughout life. In addition, people with this condition have low levels of a hormone known as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) which leads to <a href=\"http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/endocrine/adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease/Pages/fact-sheet.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">adrenal insufficiency</a>.
