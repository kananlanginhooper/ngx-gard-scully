In most cases the lesions are associated with conditions in which abnormal proteins are found in the blood (monoclonal gammopathies). NXG is also sometimes associated with blood cancers or <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=45767\" target=\"_blank\">lymphoproliferative disorders</a>. [14054][14055][14056] As these blood disorders may arise years after the first NXG lesions appear, lifelong follow-up may be recommended.[14055] Approximately 50% of people with NXG have problems with their eyes, such as burning or itching, blurred vision, double vision, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003033.htm\" target=\"_blank\">bulging of the eyeball</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001018.htm\" target=\"_blank\">drooping of the eyelid</a>, and restricted eye movement. [14055] In most cases, other parts of the body, such as the trunk, legs, face, and arms, are also involved. Internal organs may sometimes be affected.[14056] Treatment of NXG can be challenging, but is usually necessary to minimize the risk of skin ulcers and scarring. First-line therapy may include drugs used to treat cancer (such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682899.html\" target=\"_blank\">chlorambucil</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682220.html\" target=\"_blank\">melphalan</a>). Additional treatment options include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/steroids.html\" target=\"_blank\">corticosteroids</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/intravenous-immunoglobulin/\" target=\"_blank\">intravenous immunoglobulin</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a608001.html\" target=\"_blank\">lenalidomide</a>, interferon, radiation therapy, and surgery. In some cases, the symptoms of NXG may return after treatment. If NXG is associated with a blood cancer or a lymphoproliferative disorder, treatment focuses on the blood disorder.[14055][14056]","dateModified":"2017-11-13T12:11:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":8231,"relatedDiseaseName":"Non-Langerhans-Cell Histiocytosis","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
