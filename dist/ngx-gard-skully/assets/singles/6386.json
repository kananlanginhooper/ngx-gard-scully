At temperatures less than 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (normal body temperature), cryoglobulins become solid or gel-like and can block blood vessels. This causes a variety of health problems. Many people with cryoglobulins will not experience any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include purplish discolored skin (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003232.htm\" target=\"_blank\">purpura</a>), weakness, joint pain, liver disease, and kidney problems. The underlying cause is unknown. Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is typically associated with a chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. It is diagnosed based on the results of a clinical exam and the presence of cryoglobulins in the blood. Treatment varies based on the severity of symptoms and any underlying conditions.[15668][15669][15670]","dateModified":"2020-06-16T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13533,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis?&nbsp;","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis.
