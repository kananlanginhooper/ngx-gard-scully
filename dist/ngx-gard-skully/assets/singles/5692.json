Signs and symptoms of PAIS can vary greatly, causing a range of differences in genital appearance.[6271][6272] Some individuals have severe <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001286.htm\" target=_blank>hypospadias</a>, an unusually small penis, and <a href=\"http://www.accordalliance.org/learn-about-dsd/glossary/Glossary-of-Terms-1/B/bifid-scrotum-8/\" target=_blank>bifid scrotum</a>. More severely affected individuals may have female external genitalia with an abnormally large clitoris, partial fusion of the <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/labium\" target=_blank>labia</a> and gynecomastia (excessive development of male breasts).[6271] In the least severe cases, the only symptom may be infertility. PAIS It is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.geneticseducation.nhs.uk/genetics-glossary/206-x-linked-recessive\" target=_blank>X-linked recessive</a> manner and is caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=_blank>mutations</a> in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/AR\" target=_blank><em>AR</em></a> gene.
