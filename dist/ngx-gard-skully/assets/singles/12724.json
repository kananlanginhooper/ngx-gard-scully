People with this condition typically develop recurrent seizures (<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000694.htm\" target=\"_blank\">epilepsy</a>) beginning in mid-adolescence.[1823] Intelligence is usually normal, but some people may have mild intellectual disability, including difficulty with reading or spelling.

Characteristic nodules around the ventricles of the brain are then typically discovered when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are done. Patients usually have normal intelligence, although some have mild intellectual disability. Difficulty with reading and spelling has been reported in some girls with periventricular heterotopia.
