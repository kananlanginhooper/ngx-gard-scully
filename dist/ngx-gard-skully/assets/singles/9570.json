The condition can develop in normal-appearing skin or within an existing mole. ALM begins as a flat patch of discolored skin that may enlarge slowly over time. Although the cancer cells often remain contained at the skins surface (epidermis) initially, ALM can become invasive and spread as the condition advances. Like other flat forms of melanoma, it can be recognized by the <a href=\"http://preventcancer.org/our-work/programs/save-skin/check-your-skin/\" target=\"_blank\">ABCDE rule</a>. Although ALM affects men and women of all skin colors equally, is it most commonly diagnosed in people over age 40. The underlying cause of ALM is poorly understood. It is not related to sun exposure like other forms of skin cancer. Initial treatment generally consists of surgery to remove the skin lesion. Additional therapy (such as radiation therapy or immunotherapy) may then be recommended depending on the severity of the condition.[13289][13290]","dateModified":"2017-04-03T15:31:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
