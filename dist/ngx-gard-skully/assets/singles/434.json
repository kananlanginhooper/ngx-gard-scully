The X chromosome is one of the two <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=181\" target=\"_blank\">sex chromosomes</a> (the other sex chromosome is the Y chromosome). Females have two X chromosomes in each cell and males have an X chromosome and a Y chromosome in each cell. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough females have two X chromosomes, one of the X chromosomes in each cell is \"turned off\" and all of the genes on that chromosome are inactivated. Females who have a change (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a>) in a gene on one of their X chromosomes are called carriers of the related condition. Carrier females usually do not have symptoms of the condition because the X chromosome with the mutated gene is often turned off and they have another X chromosome with a working copy of the gene. Sometimes, the X chromosome with the working copy of the gene is turned off, which may cause symptoms of the condition. However, females with symptoms are usually much more mildly affected than males. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA male has only one X chromosome, so if he inherits a mutation on the X chromosome, he will have signs and symptoms (be affected).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMales with an X-linked recessive condition always pass the mutated gene to all of their daughters, who will be carriers. A male cannot pass an X-linked gene to his sons because males always pass their Y chromosome to male offspring.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFemale carriers of an X-linked recessive condition have a 25% chance with each pregnancy to have a carrier daughter like themselves, a 25% chance to have a non-carrier daughter, a 25% chance to have an affected son, and a 25% chance to have an unaffected son. This also means that each daughter of a carrier mother has a 50% chance of being a carrier, and each son has a 50% chance of having the condition.","dateModified":"2015-04-24T14:09:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[{"referenceId":3922,"authors":"","articleTitle":"L1 syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"March 2008","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/l1-syndrome","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":8653,"questionText":"How is hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius diagnosed?","answerText":"A diagnosis of hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius is typically suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms on physical examination and/or brain imaging (i.e. <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003786.htm\" target=\"_blank\">CT scan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003791.htm\" target=\"_blank\">MRI scan</a>).
