Food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis is a subset of this disorder in which symptoms develop if exertion takes place within a few hours of eating a specific food. In the case of food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, neither the food nor the exercise alone is enough to cause anaphylaxis.[12355] Vigorous forms of physical activity, such as jogging, are more commonly associated with exercise-induced anaphylaxis, although lower levels of exertion (eg, walking and yard work) are also capable of triggering attacks.[12355] However, the condition can be unpredictable; a given level of exercise may cause an episode on one occasion but not another.[12356] Symptoms of exercise-induced anaphylaxis may include itching, hives (urticaria), flushing, extreme fatigue, and wheezing. Affected individuals may also experience nausea, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea. Continuing the physical activity causes the symptoms to become worse. However, if the individual stops the activity when the symptoms first appear, there is usually improvement within minutes. [12355][12356] In most cases, these conditions are <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/sporadic/\" target=\"_blank\">sporadic</a> , though familial cases have been reported.[12356]","dateModified":"2016-10-12T16:52:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":11161,"questionText":"How might exercise-induced anaphylaxis be treated?","answerText":"Prevention remains the best treatment for patients with exercise-induced anaphylaxis.[12355] Management should include education about safe conditions for exercise, identification and avoidance of offending foods, the importance of stopping exercise immediately if symptoms develop, the appropriate use of epinephrine, and the importance of having epinephrine available at all times. Patients may also be advised to wear a medical alert bracelet with instructions on the use of epinephrine.[12355][12356] The following factors may increase the risk of an exercise-induced attack and are often considered co-factors: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alcohol, certain phases of the menstrual cycle, temperature extremes, and seasonal pollen exposure.[12356] As a result, patients may be advised to minimize their exposure to these risk factors.[12355]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2016-10-12T17:12:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":12355,"authors":"Huynh, Peter N.","articleTitle":"Exercise-Induced Anaphylaxis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape","date":"November 17, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/886641-overview","dateAccessed":"2016-10-12T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12356,"authors":"Feldweg, Anna.","articleTitle":"Exercise-induced anaphylaxis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Immunol Allergy Clin North Am","date":"2015 May","volume":"35(2)","pages":"261-275","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25841550","dateAccessed":"2016-10-12T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":11160,"questionText":"What is the long-term outlook people with exercise-induced anaphylaxis?","answerText":"The prognosis for patients with exercise-induced anaphylaxis is generally favorable.
