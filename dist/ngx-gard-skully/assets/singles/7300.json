During normal embryonic growth, immature cells that later develop into specialized nerve cells (neurons) normally migrate to the brain's surface, making several layers of cells. When this process is impaired, the cells don't migrate to their locations, resulting in too few cell layers and absence (agyria) or incomplete development (pachygyria) of gyri.[7200]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnvironmental factors that contribute to the condition may include intrauterine infection during pregnancy (such as a virus), and insufficient flow of oxygenated blood to the brain (ischemia) during fetal development.[7200]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMore than 25 syndromes due to abnormal migration of neurons have been reported; in some of these cases, the genetic cause and pattern of inheritance depends on that of the specific syndrome.[1568][1570]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">Mutations</a> in several genes have been

(also called <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DCX\" target=\"_blank\">DCX</a></em>) genes.[7200]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople interested in learning about the cause of pachygyria in themselves
