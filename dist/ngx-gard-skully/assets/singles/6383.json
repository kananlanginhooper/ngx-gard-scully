Symptoms that may develop as the cancer grows include heartburn, pain when swallowing, difficulty swallowing, a hoarse voice, a cough that does not go away, weight loss, and coughing up blood.[4884][15039] The exact cause of esophageal cancer usually is not known, but both environmental and genetic factors are thought to play a role in its development. For example, variations or mutations in any of <a href=\"https://www.omim.org/entry/133239#phenotypeMap\" target=\"_blank\">several genes</a> may cause susceptibility to esophageal cancer.[4885] Environmental factors that may increase a person's chance to develop esophageal cancer include tobacco use, heavy alcohol use, older age, obesity, and damage to the esophagus from acid reflux (<a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/barretts-esophagus\" target=\"_blank\">Barrett esophagus</a>).[4884][15039] The diagnosis may be based on imaging studies and tests such as chest X-ray, upper endoscopy, and a biopsy of tissue from the esophagus. Treatment options and the chance of recovery&nbsp;depend on the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/stage\" target=\"_blank\">stage of the cancer</a>, whether it can be surgically removed, and a person's general health. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/laser-therapy\" target=\"_blank\">laser therapy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/electrocoagulation\" target=\"_blank\">electrocoagulation</a>. Other treatment options, such as <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/targeted-therapy\" target=\"_blank\">targeted therapy</a>, are being studied in clinical trials. When it is found very early, there is a better chance of recovery. When the cancer is more advanced, it can be treated but rarely can be cured.[15039]","dateModified":"2018-11-01T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
