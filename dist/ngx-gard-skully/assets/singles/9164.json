It belongs to a group of conditions known as caveolinopathies. Signs and symptoms of the condition generally begin during late childhood or adolescence, although the age of onset can vary widely. It is characterized&nbsp;by signs of increased muscle irritability, including percussion-induced rapid contractions (repetitive tensing of the muscle), percussion-induced muscle mounding (\"bunching up\" of the muscle), and/or visible rippling of the muscles. Fatigue, cramps, and/or muscle stiffness are common, especially after strenuous activity or exposure to cold temperatures. Some affected people may also have hypertrophy (overgrowth) of some muscles and an <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003199.htm\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">unusual gait</a>.
