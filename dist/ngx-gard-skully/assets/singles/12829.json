Some people with NTM lung disease have no signs or symptoms, while others experience a severe cough, hemoptysis (coughing up blood), shortness of breath, fatigue, fever, night sweats and/or weightloss. Mycobacteria are found naturally in soil and water. Most people who are exposed to these bacteria do not become sick.
