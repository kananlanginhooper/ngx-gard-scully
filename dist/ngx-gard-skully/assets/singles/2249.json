In people affected by this condition, the thoracic aorta (the upper part of the aorta, near the heart) may become weakened, stretched and/or enlarged. This can lead to a sudden tear of the inner wall of the aorta that allows blood to flow between the aorta's inner and outer walls (also called a dissection). These aortic abnormalities can be life-threatening as they can decrease blood flow to other parts of the body and/or cause the aorta to rupture. The onset of the condition varies significantly from person to person, even within the same family. Familial TAAD can be caused by changes (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>) in several different <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/familial-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-and-dissection/show/Related+Gene(s)\" target=\"_blank\">genes</a> and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner.[11150][11151] Treatment is generally based on the signs and symptoms present in each person and may include medications to reduce stress on the&nbsp;aorta and surgery to repair aortic abnormalities.
