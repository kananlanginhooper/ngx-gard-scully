Severity varies, but most patients have profound developmental impairment and some patients die in infancy (summary by Koenig et al., 2017).","Disease__c":"Gamma aminobutyric acid transaminase deficiency","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C0342708","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
