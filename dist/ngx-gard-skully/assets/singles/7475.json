The overgrowth is usually asymmetric, which means it affects the right and left sides of the body differently. Newborns with&nbsp;<span class=\"ghr-condition\">Proteus syndrome</span>&nbsp;have few or no signs of the disorder. Overgrowth becomes apparent between the ages of 6 and 18 months and becomes more severe with age. It may result in differences in appearance and&nbsp;with time, an increased risk for blood clots and tumors. Some people with <span class=\"ghr-condition\">Proteus syndrome</span> have neurological abnormalities, including intellectual disability, seizures, and vision loss, as well as distinctive facial features.[7391] Proteus syndrome is caused by a change (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a>) in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/AKT1\" target=\"_blank\">AKT1</a></em> gene.

The mutation in the <em>AKT1</em> gene is known as &ldquo;c. 49G&gt;A, p.Glu17Lys,&rdquo; and it is  a type of an &ldquo;activating mutation.&rdquo;&nbsp; This means that the&nbsp;<em>AKT1</em> gene has a &ldquo;spelling error&rdquo; that causes an abnormally active protein to be made in the body. This active protein is thought to increase rates of cell growth and may prevent cells from dying off when they naturally would. Increased cell proliferation in various tissues and organs leads to the abnormal growth characteristics and to an increased risk to develop tumors.[7391][4190][13104]","dateModified":"2017-03-02T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":4190,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Newly Diagnosed","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Proteus Syndrome Foundation","date":"","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.proteus-syndrome.org/newly-diagnosed.html","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":7391,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Proteus syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"June 2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/proteus-syndrome","dateAccessed":"2014-05-12T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13104,"authors":"Barry M","articleTitle":"Proteus syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"February, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/948174","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}]},{"caseId":22292,"abbreviatedInquiry":"How can I learn about research opportunities at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that are enrolling children with Proteus syndrome?","caseQuestions":[{"questionId":1040,"questionText":"How can I learn about research opportunities at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that are enrolling children with Proteus syndrome?","answerText":"The U.S. National Institutes of Health, through the National Library of Medicine, developed <a href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> to provide patients, family members, and members of the public with current information on clinical research studies.&nbsp;There is a clinical trial titled \"Study of Proteus Syndrome and Related Congenital Disorders\" that may be of interest to you.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00001403?term=proteus+syndrome&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to view&nbsp;the study abstract.
