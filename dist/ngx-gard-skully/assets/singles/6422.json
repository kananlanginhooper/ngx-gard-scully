Weakness is recurrent, affecting mainly the limbs, and is often brought on by exercising or eating too many or too few carbohydrates.[13578] There are 4 forms of familial periodic paralysis:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis\" target=\"_blank\">hypokalemic</a>, <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis\" target=\"_blank\">hyperkalemic</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000319.htm\" target=\"_blank\">thyrotoxic</a>, and <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/andersen-tawil-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Andersen-Tawil syndrome</a>. In the hypokalemic form, the paralysis is caused by low levels of potassium. In the hyperkalemic form, the paralysis is caused by high levels of potassium in the blood. In the thyrotoxic form, the paralysis is caused by low levels of potassium in the blood and  an overactive thyroid gland (<a href=\"http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/hormonal-and-metabolic-disorders/thyroid-gland-disorders/hyperthyroidism\">hyperthyroidism</a>). In Andersen-Tawil syndrome, potassium levels can be high, low, or normal.[13578][13579] Mutations in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CACNA1S\"><em>CACNA1S</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SCN4A\"><em>SCN4A</em></a>&nbsp;genes cause&nbsp;hypokalemic periodic paralysis.[13581]&nbsp;The hyperkalemic form is due to mutations in <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SCN4A\"><em>SCN4A</em></a>&nbsp;gene.[13582] The underlying cause of the thyrotoxic form is unknown.
