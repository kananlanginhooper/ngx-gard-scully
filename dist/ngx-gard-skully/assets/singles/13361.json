Both brothers had behavioral problems, such as aggressiveness, impulsivity, and self-injury.[13755] &nbsp;It is caused by mutations in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ELP2\" target=\"_blank\"><em>ELP2</em></a> gene. In the reported cases inheritance seems to be autosomal recessive.[13754] There is no report of specific treatment.&nbsp;","dateModified":"2017-09-04T13:14:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
