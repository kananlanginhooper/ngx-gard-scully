SGBS is an overgrowth disorder, meaning that people with the disease are larger than average at birth (macrosomia) and continue&nbsp;to grow and gain weight at an unusual rate. The severity&nbsp;varies from very mild forms in <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/?id=23\" target=\"_blank\">carrier</a> females to infantile lethal forms in affected males. The infantile lethal form of SGBS is sometimes known as SGBS type 2.[3030][14613]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople with SGBS typically have distinctive facial features, including a large distance between the eyes (<a href=\"https://www.childrens.com/specialties-services/specialty-centers-and-programs/plastic-craniofacial-surgery/programs-and-services/craniofacial-program/conditions-and-treatments/hypertelorism\" target=\"_blank\">hypertelorism</a>), an unusually wide mouth (<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=macrostomia\" target=\"_blank\">macrostomia</a>) with a large tongue (<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/3342/macroglossia\" target=\"_blank\">macroglossia</a>), and abnormalities of the roof of the mouth (palate).[3024] Other,  findings include&nbsp;extra nipples, various birth defects such as a protrusion of the lining of the abdomen through the area around the belly button (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000987.htm\" target=\"_blank\">umbilical hernia</a>), and skeletal anomalies.[3024][3025] Some people with the condition have a mild to severe intellectual disability. About 10 percent of people with SGBS develop tumors in early childhood, including a rare type of kidney cancer (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/wilmstumor.html\" target=\"_blank\">Wilms tumor</a>)&nbsp;and cancer of the nerve tissue (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/neuroblastoma.html\" target=\"_blank\">neuroblastoma</a>). SGBS can be caused by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GPC3\" target=\"_blank\"><em>GPC3</em></a>&nbsp;and <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GPC4\" target=\"_blank\">GPC4</a></em> genes. Mutations in other genes have been studied, but have in most instances have only been described in one person or one family. In other cases, the cause is unknown.[3024] SGBS is inherited in an X-linked  manner.[3029] Although there is no specific treatment or cure, there can be ways to manage the symptoms. A team of doctors is often needed to figure out the treatment options based on each person&rsquo;s symptoms.<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2018-05-10T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":4081,"questionText":"What is the prognosis and life expectancy for individuals with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome?","answerText":"The spectrum of signs and symptoms associated with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome&nbsp;is very broad, varying from very mild forms in carrier females to infantile lethal forms in affected males. As many as 50% of affected males die in the newborn period, although the causes of this high mortality remain unknown;[3030] it has been suggested that it is probably related to cardiac abnornalities.[3029] People with milder cases often live into adulthood.[3024] Because of the varying degrees of manifestations and severity associated with the condition, prediction of prognosis and life expectancy most likely varies on an individual basis.","dateModified":"2011-05-27T15:44:00","resourceClassificationName":"Prognosis","references":[{"referenceId":3024,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"July 2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/simpson-golabi-behmel-syndrome","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":3029,"authors":"Garcia-Minaur S, Lapunzina Badia P, Martinez-Glen V, Nevado Blanco J, Santos Simarro F, Antonio Tenorio Castano J","articleTitle":"Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet","date":"April 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=en&Expert=373","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":3030,"authors":"Neri G, Gurrieri F, Zanni G, Lin A","articleTitle":"Clinical and Molecular Aspects of the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"American Journal of Medical Genetics","date":"1998","volume":"79(4)","pages":"279-283","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9781908","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
