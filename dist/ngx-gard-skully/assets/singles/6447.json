People with trimethylaminuria are unable to break down trimethylamine. Trimethylamine comes from specific chemicals (choline, carnitine, TMAO) found in certain foods. The excess trimethylamine builds up and is the source of the odor. There are no other physical symptoms from trimethylaminuria, but people with this condition may experience serious psychological and social distress. Trimethylaminuria is due to a <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FMO3\" target=\"_blank\">FMO3</a></em> gene that is not working correctly. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. It is diagnosed based on the symptoms, clinical exam, urine analysis, and can be confirmed by genetic testing. Treatment for trimethylaminuria mainly includes diet modification, acidic soaps and lotions, and vitamin B12 supplements. Other treatment options include antibiotics, activated charcoal, and probiotics.[5543][15785][15786][15787][15788]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2020-09-09T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":76,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of trimethylaminuria?","answerText":"Trimethylaminuria causes people to have a rotten fish smell.&nbsp;This odor can be different from person to person.
