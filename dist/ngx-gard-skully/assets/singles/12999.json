A large tongue (macroglossia) and horizontal eyebrows may also be present. Children with the syndrome may tend to keep their mouth open to varying degrees. As babies with the syndrome grow, they usually are delayed in meeting milestones, such as sitting and walking independently. Speech is almost always delayed and speech problems may be severe.  Most babies and children with the syndrome also have weak muscle tone (hypotonia). Intellectual disability usually ranges from mild to moderate. Developmental delays can range from mild to severe.[13535][11393][13536][11391] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome infants with MED13L haploinsufficiency syndrome are born with heart defects, because the heart did not form properly.
