As the name suggests, FML is diagnosed when multiple lipomatosis occurs in more than one family member, often over several generations. The lipomas associated with FML are usually painless, but may impact quality of life as they can be numerous and large.[11109][11110] Although the condition appears to be passed down through families in an autosomal dominant manner, the underlying genetic cause is currently unknown.[11108] Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002305.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Surgical excision</a> may be necessary if the tumors interfere with movement and/or daily life.[11109][11110]","dateModified":"2018-03-15T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
