It is characterized by the impaired function of specialized blood cells, called platelets, that are essential for proper blood clotting. Signs and symptoms vary greatly from person to person. Symptoms usually include abnormal bleeding, which can be severe. Other symptoms may include easy bruising, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003106.htm\" target=_blank>nose bleeds</a>, bleeding from the gums, and/or heavy menstrual bleeding. Rarely, internal bleeding and blood in the urine (<a href=\"http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/hematuria/#what\" target=_blank>hematuria</a>) can occur. Prolonged untreated or unsuccessfully treated bleeding may be life threatening.
