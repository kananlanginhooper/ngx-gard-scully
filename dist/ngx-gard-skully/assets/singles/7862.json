The symptoms of VKH occur in different phases. The early symptoms include headaches, eye pain, and dizziness. These are followed by hearing loss and inflammation of the eye (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001005.htm\" target=\"_blank\">panuveitis</a>). Later symptoms include development of white patches of skin and hair (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/vitiligo.html\" target=\"_blank\">vitiligo</a>), hair loss (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/hairloss.html\" target=\"_blank\">alopecia</a>), <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cataract.html\" target=\"_blank\">cataracts</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/glaucoma.html\" target=\"_blank\">glaucoma</a>. The exact cause of VKH disease is unknown, but the symptoms are thought to be due to an abnormal response of the immune system to a viral infection. Genetic factors may be involved. Diagnosis of VKH disease is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and imaging studies. Other more common diseases may need to excluded before a diagnosis of VKH disease is made. VKH disease is treated with corticosteroids and other medications.[15751][15752][15753][15754]","dateModified":"2020-08-24T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":3757,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease.
