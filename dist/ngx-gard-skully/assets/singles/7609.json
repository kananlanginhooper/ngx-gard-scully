The&nbsp;skin lesions may spread over time, or clear up on their own.[1699]&nbsp;The cause of pigmented purpuric dermatosis is unknown. While treatment may not be necessary, <a href=\"http://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/topical-steroids/\" target=\"_blank\">topical steroids</a> may help control itching.

Depending on the type of PPD a person has, additional signs and symptoms may include red-brown patches, plaques, linear lesions, itching, and/or other features.&nbsp;In general, PPD does not cause serious health problems but is a chronic condition. Signs and symptoms may persist, wax and wane, or slowly progress, and may go away over a period of months to years.[15418]","dateModified":"2019-10-21T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":15418,"authors":"Garg A","articleTitle":"Pigmented purpuric dermatoses (capillaritis)","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"September, 2019","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pigmented-purpuric-dermatoses-capillaritis","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"Waltham, MA","publisher":"UpToDate"}]},{"questionId":3274,"questionText":"What causes pigmented purpuric eruption?","answerText":"The cause of pigmented purpuric dermatosis is unknown.[1699][1700] Occasionally, it occurs as a reaction to a medication, food additive, viral infection or following exercise.[1700] In rare cases, there appears to be a genetic component.[1699]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2016-10-05T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":1699,"authors":"Mehregan D","articleTitle":"Pigmented Purpuric Dermatitis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"eMedicine Journal","date":"March 31, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1084594-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":1700,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Capillaritis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"DermNet New Zealand","date":"January 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/capillaritis/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":2646,"questionText":"What treatment is available for pigmented purpuric eruption?","answerText":"If the condition is mild, treatment may not be necessary.
