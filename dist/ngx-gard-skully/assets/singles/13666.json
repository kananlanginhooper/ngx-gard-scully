Most individuals start out having normal development with normal motor skills and speech. Over time, affected individuals have neurological and developmental symptoms that slowly get worse. Symptoms can include loss of speech, abnormal movements, loss of muscle control, and seizures. Other symptoms include abnormal eye movements, loss of motor milestones (like crawling and walking), and difficulty swallowing. Intellectual ability may or may not be affected. The age of onset of symptoms ranges from early childhood to adulthood.[15077][15078][15079]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe severity of symptoms seems to be related to the type of mutation found in the <em>IRF2BPL</em> gene.
