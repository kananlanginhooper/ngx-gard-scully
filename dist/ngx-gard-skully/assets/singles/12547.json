SIgMD can occur in infants, children, or adults.[8783] The disorder may occur as a primary disorder (on its own) or more commonly, as a secondary disorder (associated with another underlying disease or condition). SIgMD may occur in association with some cancers, autoimmune diseases, <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/allergic-diseases/overview\" target=\"_blank\">allergic diseases</a>, and gastrointestinal diseases.[14189][8785]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSymptoms of SIgMD may include repeated viral, bacterial, or fungal infections, such as ear infections, bronchitis, <a href=\"https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions-dictionary/sinuses,-sinusitis,-rhinosinusitis\" target=\"_blank\">sinusitis</a>, and pneumonia.[8783] Infections may be life-threatening.[14189] Repeated infections are common in infants with SIgMD.[8783][8785] In some people, diarrhea or a skin rash is the first symptom.[8783] Others do not have symptoms specific to SIgMD and are diagnosed when being evaluated for another condition.[8783][8785] The diagnosis is made by blood tests showing low or absent IgM and normal levels of other antibodies, as well as diagnosing or ruling out underlying conditions that can cause low levels of IgM.[8783]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cause of SIgMD is still unclear.[8783][14189][8785] SIgMD usually occurs in only one person in a family, but familial cases have occasionally been reported.[14189] It may occur in some people with chromosome disorders such as <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10299/22q112-deletion-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">22q11.2 deletion syndrome</a>.[14189]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are no official treatment recommendations since information about SIgMD is limited.[8783] Treatment options depend on the severity of symptoms and whether a person has an associated underlying disease.

Some people do not have any symptoms and are diagnosed by chance while being evaluated for another health problem. Others may experience mild to severe symptoms depending on the degree of the deficiency. Whether a person has primary or secondary SIgMD (associated with another underlying condition) also plays a role in the types of symptoms a person has, as they may also have symptoms of their underlying condition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost people with SIgMD, especially infants, have repeated bacterial and viral infections. Common infections in people with SIgMD include ear infections, sinus infections (<a href=\"https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions-dictionary/sinuses,-sinusitis,-rhinosinusitis\" target=\"_blank\">sinusitis</a>), bronchitis, and pneumonia. Some of these infections can result in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/sepsis.html\" target=\"_blank\">sepsis</a>, which can be life-threatening.
