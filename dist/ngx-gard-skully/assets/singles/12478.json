Platelets are important for helping the blood to clot. Symptoms of a bleeding disorder due to P2RY12 defect include frequent nose bleeds, easy bruising, and excessive bleeding after surgery or an accident. These symptoms can vary from person to person. This condition is very rare and it's not clear how it changes over time. Bleeding disorder due to a P2RY12 defect occur due to a variant in the <em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/64805\" target=\"_blank\">P2RY12</a></em> gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and the results of specialized laboratory testing. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms, and may involve blood transfusions, and/or medications that help the blood clot.[15898][15899][15900][15901][15902]","dateModified":"2020-11-13T12:54:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13735,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of bleeding disorder due to P2RY12 defect?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with bleeding disorder due to P2RY12 defect.
