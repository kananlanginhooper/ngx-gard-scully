SLS causes a cystic kidney disease called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/nephronophthisis\" target=\"_blank\">nephronophthisis</a>, which usually begins in early childhood. The kidneys develop cysts, inflammation, and scarring, which progressively impair kidney function. Symptoms of nephronophthisis may include increased production of urine, excessive thirst, weakness, and severe fatigue. Nephronophthisis typically leads to <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000500.htm\" target=\"_blank\">end-stage kidney disease</a>&nbsp;by adolescence.[8641][14286][14287]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSLS affects the eyes by causing varying degrees of retinal dystrophy, which is progressive wasting of the retina (the part of the eye that senses light and sends images to the brain). Some children with SLS have a severe type of retinal dystrophy at birth called <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/634/leber-congenital-amaurosis\" target=\"_blank\">Leber congenital amaurosis</a> (LCA). Symptoms of LCA include severe <a href=\"https://nei.nih.gov/healthyeyes/hyperopia\" target=\"_blank\">farsightedness</a>, light sensitivity (photophobia), and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003037.htm\" target=\"_blank\">nystagmus</a>.[8641][14287] Other children with SLS do not have LCA but later develop symptoms of a retinal dystrophy called <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/5694/retinitis-pigmentosa\" target=\"_blank\">retinitis pigmentosa</a> (RP). Symptoms of RP range in age of onset and severity, and may include night blindness, progressive loss of peripheral vision, and eventual loss of central vision, leading to blindness.[14287][14288]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn rare cases, additional symptoms such as <a href=\"http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/liver-and-gallbladder-disorders/fibrosis-and-cirrhosis-of-the-liver/fibrosis-of-the-liver\" target=\"_blank\">liver fibrosis</a>&nbsp;or skeletal abnormalities have been reported.[14287][14290]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSLS may be caused by mutations in any of several genes, and inheritance is autosomal recessive. The syndrome can be diagnosed based on symptoms,  kidney and eye evaluations, and genetic testing.[14287]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment during earlier stages of kidney disease in children includes maintaining a healthy balance of fluid and electrolytes. End-stage kidney disease requires dialysis, or kidney transplantation. After transplantation, kidney damage does not occur again.[14287][14291] End-stage kidney disease can be life-threatening if not treated. There is currently no treatment to prevent or stop the progression of vision loss due to retinal dystrophy, but  various <a href=\"https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/low-vision-aids-rehabilitation\" target=\"_blank\">low-vision aids</a> may be helpful for those who have remaining vision.[14287]","dateModified":"2015-04-13T16:49:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":8641,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Senior-Løken syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"June 2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/senior-loken-syndrome","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
