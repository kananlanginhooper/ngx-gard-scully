In actinic LP, specifically, affected people develop mildly itchy, coin-shaped patches on sun exposed areas such as the face, the neck and the backs of the hands.[9321][9322] It is extremely rare in Caucasians but it is more common in dark-skinned populations. The exact underlying cause of actinic LP is unknown.[9324] Treatment is not always necessary as some cases of&nbsp;actinic LP resolve on their own. Mild cases can often be managed with <a href=\"http://dermnetnz.org/treatments/topical-steroids.html\" target=\"_blank\">topical steroids</a>, while more intensive therapies may be required for severe cases.[9321][9322]","dateModified":"2015-07-15T21:33:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12344,"relatedDiseaseName":"Rare lichen planus","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
