The term &ldquo;polyangiitis&rdquo; refers to swelling of many different types of blood vessels.[14265]&nbsp; <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first sign of GPA may be a recurrent respiratory infection, or a cough or runny nose that continues for longer than expected.[4003] Other common symptoms of the disease include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003106.htm\">nosebleeds</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003261.htm\">joint pain</a>, weakness, tiredness (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fatigue.html\">fatigue</a>), weight loss, or an unexplained fever.[14266] In some cases, the disease can cause the bridge of the nose to collapse, resulting in a <a href=\"https://www.rhinoplastyinseattle.com/service/seattle-plastic-surgery-treatments/rhinoplasty-treatments/saddle-nose-deformity\">saddle-nose deformity</a>.

For most people, the symptoms of GPA improve with treatment.[1648][4003] In cases where a person has severe GPA that is not diagnosed or treated, there is a very high risk of death that can be caused by infection, <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/respiratory-failure\">respiratory failure</a> (when too little oxygen passes from the lungs to the blood), <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/kidneyfailure.html\">kidney failure</a>, and damage to the heart.[4003]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost people with GPA receive treatment for about 18 months after they begin to recover from the disease. Receiving treatment for this length of time is aimed at preventing the symptoms from returning (relapse). However, about half of people with GPA may experience a return of the disease.[1648][4003] This usually occurs within two years of stopping treatment. Therefore, it is extremely important that people with GPA continue to see their healthcare professionals regularly, both while receiving treatment and after stopping the medications.[4003]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span>After starting treatment for GPA, most people notice that their symptoms improve. However, the medications that help treat GPA can also cause serious side-effects such as bone weakening and having an immune system that is less able to fight off infection.
