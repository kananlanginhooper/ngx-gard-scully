Signs and symptoms appear to vary depending on the age group. Initial symptoms in children and young adults often include&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/anemia.html\" target=\"_blank\">anemia</a>&nbsp;and abdominal pain, whereas older adults often have chronic watery diarrhea associated with <a href=\"http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/collagenouscolitis/\" target=\"_blank\">collagenous colitis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/celiacdisease.html\" target=\"_blank\">celiac disease</a> or both.[5591][8776] Adult collagenous gastritis is also associated with autoimmune diseases such as Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, lymphocytic gastritis, lymphocytic colitis, and ulcerative colitis.[8776] Other signs and symptoms of CG may include nausea and vomiting, weight loss, abdominal distention, and gastrointestinal bleeding.[8776] The cause of the condition is unclear.[5591] Because of the small number of cases, no standard therapy for CG has been established based on randomized, controlled clinical trials.[8776]","dateModified":"2018-09-06T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6509,"questionText":"How might collagenous gastritis be treated?","answerText":"Because collagenous gastritis is very rare and its cause is unknown, there is currently no established standard therapy for the condition.
