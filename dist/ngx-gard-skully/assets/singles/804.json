The liver problems result from having fewer small bile ducts than normal in the liver. This leads to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002237.htm\" target=\"_blank\">bile</a> building-up inside the liver, which in turn causes liver scarring and damage.[2141] Signs and symptoms of Alagille syndrome are generally noticed in infancy or early childhood. Type of symptoms and severity varies greatly, even among people in the same family, so that in some cases the symptoms are severe, and in others, very mild. The liver problems  may be the first symptoms of the syndrome, and may include yellow color of the skin and whites of the eyes (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003243.htm\" target=\"_blank\">jaundice</a>); itchy skin; bumps on the skin caused by deposits of cholesterol and fats (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001447.htm\" target=\"_blank\">xanthomas</a>); pale, loose bowel movements; and poor growth. [2141][2142] Alagille syndrome can also affect other parts of the body including the heart, brain, kidneys, blood vessels, eyes, face, and skeleton. People with Alagille syndrome may have distinctive facial features too, including a broad, prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, and a small, pointed chin.[2141] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlagille syndrome is caused by changes or mutations in the <a class=\"link-dapple\" title=\"J A G 1\" href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene=jag1\" target=\"_blank\"><span><em>JAG1</em></span></a> and <a class=\"link-dapple\" title=\"N O T C H 2\" href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene=notch2\" target=\"_blank\"><span><em>NOTCH2</em></span></a> genes.&nbsp; Inheritance is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>.

The severity of the syndrome varies greatly, even within the same family.[2143][5607] Symptoms range from so mild as to go unnoticed to severe enough to require heart and/or liver transplants. Symptoms may include:[2142][2143][5607][13981]&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Liver problems</strong>: One of the major features of Alagille syndrome is liver damage caused by abnormalities in the bile ducts. These ducts carry bile, which helps to digest fats, from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine. In Alagille syndrome, the bile ducts may be narrow, malformed, and reduced in number. This results in a build-up of bile causing scarring that prevents the liver from working properly. This may lead to </span><a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000210.htm\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">jaundice</a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">, itchy skin, and deposits of cholesterol in the skin (xanthomas). </span></li>\r\n    <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Nutrition problems</strong>: Since bile is important for the digestion and absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins, people with Alagille syndrome may have a hard time getting enough calories and may develop Vitamin A, D, E and/or K deficiencies. Calcium and zinc deficiencies may also be associated with Alagille syndrome. Many people with Alagille syndrome continue to have nutrition problems even after a liver transplant, suggesting that other factors of the syndrome may play a role. Malnutrition can lead to slow growth, delayed puberty and other health concerns.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n    <li><strong>Heart problems</strong>: Alagille syndrome is also associated with several heart problems, including impaired blood flow from the heart into the lungs (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001096.htm\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">pulmonic stenosis</a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">).&nbsp;Other associated heart-related problems include a&nbsp;hole between the two lower chambers of the heart (</span><a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001099.htm\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">ventricular septal defect</a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">) and&nbsp;a combination of heart defects called </span><a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/tof/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">tetralogy of Fallot</a>.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Distinctive facial features</strong>: People with Alagille syndrome may have distinctive facial features, such as&nbsp; a broad, prominent forehead; deep-set eyes; and a small, pointed chin.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Neurologic problems</strong>: Some people with Alagille syndrome may have intellectual disabilities and developmental delay.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Vascular problems</strong>: Alagille syndrome can be associated with abnormalities of the blood vessels in the head and neck, which can lead to spontaneous or injury-induced bleeding in the skull or brain, or a stroke. Alagille syndrome can also cause narrowing (stenosis) or bulging (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/aneurysms.html\" target=\"_blank\">aneurysm</a>) of other blood vessels in the body.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Kidney problems</strong>: Some children may have impaired kidney function such as <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/renal-artery-stenosis\" target=\"_blank\">kidney artery stenosis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.kidneypathology.com/English_version/Minimal_change_disease.html\" target=\"_blank\">lipoid nephrosis</a>, or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/spanish/ency/article/000478.htm\" target=\"_blank\">glomerulosclerosis</a>.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Bone problems</strong>: People may have&nbsp; an unusual butterfly shape of the bones of the spinal column (vertebrae) but this shape almost never causes any problems with the function of the nerves in the spinal cord. However, Vitamin D deficiency can lead to <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000344.htm\" target=\"_blank\">rickets</a>&nbsp;or weakened bones and poor growth. Calcium deficiency and other features of Alagille syndrome can also lead to poor growth, abnormally shaped bones, and increased risk of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000001.htm\" target=\"_blank\">broken bones</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Eye problems</strong>: Eye abnormalities are common in Alagille syndrome, but for the most part do not require treatment and do not cause vision loss. The most common eye finding is an extra, circular line on the surface of the eye, called a posterior embryotoxon, that can be detected during a specialized eye examination. Although about 90% of people with Alagille syndrome have this eye finding, so do up to 15% of people who do not have this syndrome.&nbsp;Other eye findings may include Axenfeld anomaly,  in which strands of the colored part of the eye (iris) are abnormally attached to the cornea, and color changes of the retina (retinal pigmentary changes).</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Pancreatic insufficiency</strong>: Alagille syndrome can cause pancreatic insufficiency. People whose pancreas does not produce enough enzymes to help digest food do not properly absorb fat from food (fat malabsorption) and excrete fat in their bowel movements. Pancreatic insufficiency can cause poor nutrition and growth and therefore is believed to play a larger role than first suspected in the nutritional problems for people with Alagille syndrome.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>More&nbsp;information about the symptoms associated with Alagille syndrome can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/alagille-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Alagille Syndrome</a> information page and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1273/#alagille.Clinical_Description\" target=\"_blank\">GeneReviews Alagille Syndrome Report</a>.</p>","dateModified":"2017-10-20T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":2142,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Alagille Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"American Liver Foundation","date":"","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.liverfoundation.org/abouttheliver/info/alagille/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":2143,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Alagille syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=alagillesyndrome","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":5607,"authors":"Spinner NB, Hitchinson AL, Krantz ID, Kamath BM","articleTitle":"Alagille Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1273/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13981,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Alagille Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania (CHOP)","date":"","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/alagille-syndrome","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":12313,"questionText":"How might Alagille syndrome be treated?","answerText":"Many doctors may be necessary for the best management of Alagille syndrome, including specialists in medical genetics, gastroenterology (for digestive system and liver problems), nephrology (for kidney problems), nutrition, cardiology (for heart problems), ophthalmology (for eye problems), liver transplantation, and child development.

The diet usually is a high-calorie diet, calcium, and with vitamins A, D, E, and K, and sometimes  zinc. Sometimes a&nbsp; child may receive additional calories through a tiny tube that is passed through the nose into the stomach. If extra calories are needed for a long time, a doctor may place a tube, called a gastrostomy tube, directly into the stomach through a small opening made in the abdomen. Nutrition management may need to continue throughout a person's lifetime, but especially during childhood, with careful monitoring and balancing of nutrients, fat, calories, fat-soluble vitamins, calcium, and zinc.

In fact, before genetic testing, a person with only these findings would not have been diagnosed with Alagille syndrome. People with only minor findings will not need treatment and can lead normal, productive lives unaffected by the complications of the syndrome. However, they do have a 50% chance of passing the genetic change causing Alagille syndrome onto each of their children, and it is not possible to predict how severely affected any of their children who inherit Alagille syndrome will be.[5607][13981]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor those with more serious symptoms of Alagille syndrome, the outlook depends on several factors, including the severity of liver damage and heart problems, and the early and continued correction of nutrition problems. Predicting who will experience improved bile flow and who will progress to end-stage liver failure is difficult since for some liver function improves over time. About 15% or more of the people with Alagille syndrome will eventually require a liver transplant.[2141][5607][13981]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Children born with severe heart problems or who have serious liver problems may have a shortened lifespan.[2141][13968] However, due to improvements in liver and heart therapies, people are living longer, and those who respond well to the treatments and management of the syndrome, may lead normal, productive lives as adults. Deaths associated with Alagille syndrome are most often caused by liver failure, serious heart problems, or blood vessel abnormalities that cause bleeding in the brain or skull or strokes.[2141][13981]</span>","dateModified":"2017-10-20T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Prognosis","references":[{"referenceId":2141,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Alagille Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"http://www.albireopharma.com/programs/a4250","date":"January, 2019","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/alagille/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":5607,"authors":"Spinner NB, Hitchinson AL, Krantz ID, Kamath BM","articleTitle":"Alagille Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1273/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13968,"authors":"Scheimann A","articleTitle":"Alagille Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"January 10, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://reference.medscape.com/article/926678-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13981,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Alagille Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania (CHOP)","date":"","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/alagille-syndrome","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
