Symptoms include progressive dystonia (a movement disorder resulting in muscular spasms, twisting, and repetitive movements) spasticity, parkinsonism (slurred or slow speech, stiffness of the muscles, slow movement, and visible tremors), inability to coordinate movements (ataxia), neuropsychiatric abnormalities (confusion, disorientation, seizures, stupor, dementia), and eye problems, such as optic atrophy or retinal degeneration. The age of onset ranges from infancy to late adulthood, and the rate of progression varies. Some subtypes have cognitive decline.[12943][12944] Cerebellar atrophy is common in many cases.[12943] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are ten recognized types of NBIA, classified according to the altered gene that causes the disease. These genes include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PANK2\" target=\"_blank\"><em><span>PANK2</span></em></a>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PLA2G6\" target=\"_blank\">PLA2G6</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/C19orf12\" target=\"_blank\">C19orf12</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FA2H\" target=\"_blank\">FA2H</a></em>,<em><span> </span><span><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ATP13A2\" target=\"_blank\">ATP13A2</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/WDR45\" target=\"_blank\">WDR45</a></span></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/COASY\" target=\"_blank\">COASY</a></em><em>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FTL\" target=\"_blank\">FTL</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CP\" target=\"_blank\">CP</a></em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DCAF17\" target=\"_blank\"> DCAF17</a>. Eight of the ten types of NBIA are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The type known as beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), caused by mutations in the <em>WDR45</em> gene, is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. The neuroferritinopathy, caused by mutations in the <em>FTL</em> gene, is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.[12943] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is no cure for NBIA.[12944][12946] Treatment is symptomatic, and includes medication such as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Medications/Lioresal\" target=\"_blank\">baclofen</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682160.html\" target=\"_blank\">trihexyphenidyl</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/botox.html\" target=\"_blank\">botulinum toxin</a>, and a procedure known as &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/treatment/surgery-treatment-options/Deep-Brain-Stimulation\" target=\"_blank\">deep brain stimulation</a>&nbsp;to treat dystonia.[12943] &nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601068.html\" target=\"_blank\">Levodopa</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/treatment/Medications-for-Motor-Symptoms/Anticholinergic-Drugs\" target=\"_blank\">anticholinergic drugs</a>&nbsp;may also bring some relief of parkinsonian symptoms.[12946]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.nbiadisorders.org/about-nbia/overview-of-nbia-disorders\" target=\"_blank\">NBIA Disorders Association</a> has detailed information about NBIA.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","dateModified":"2017-01-20T13:25:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":9499,"relatedDiseaseName":"Aceruloplasminemia","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12570,"relatedDiseaseName":"Beta-Propeller Protein-Associated Neurodegeneration ","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12571,"relatedDiseaseName":"COASY Protein-Associated Neurodegeneration ","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":10810,"relatedDiseaseName":"Fatty acid hydroxylase-associated neurodegeneration","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":608,"relatedDiseaseName":"Hypogonadism, alopecia, diabetes mellitus, intellectual disability, and extrapyramidal syndrome","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false},{"relatedDiseaseId":3957,"relatedDiseaseName":"Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12569,"relatedDiseaseName":"Mitochondrial Membrane Protein-Associated Neurodegeneration ","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":10686,"relatedDiseaseName":"Neuroferritinopathy","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":6564,"relatedDiseaseName":"Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":9174,"relatedDiseaseName":"Parkinson disease type 9","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12567,"relatedDiseaseName":"PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
