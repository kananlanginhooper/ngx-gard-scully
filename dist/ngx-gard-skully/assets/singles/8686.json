They can also have a variety of <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/autoimmunediseases.html\" target=\"_blank\">autoimmune disorders</a>, most of which damage the blood cells. Some of the autoimmune disorders associated with ALPS can also damage&nbsp;the kidneys, liver, eyes, nerves, or connective tissues.
