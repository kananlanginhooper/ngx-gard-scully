It is characterized by multiple types of seizures and intellectual disability.[6188] This condition can be caused by brain malformations, perinatal asphyxia (lack of oxygen), severe head injury, central nervous system infection and inherited degenerative or metabolic conditions. In about one-third of cases, no cause can be found.[6188][6189] Treatment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome includes anti-epileptic medications such as <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682412.html\" target=_blank>valproate</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a695007.html\" target=_blank>lamotrigine</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a606011.html\" target=_blank>felbamate</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a697012.html\" target=_blank>topiramate</a>.
