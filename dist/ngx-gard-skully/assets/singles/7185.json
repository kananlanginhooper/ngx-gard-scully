It most often develops in infancy and may be diagnosed in the first month of life. The tumor most often develops in the <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=46678\" target=\"_blank\">adrenal gland</a>, but may develop in the neck, chest, or spinal cord. It is considered an <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=46053\" target=\"_blank\">aggressive tumor</a> because it often spreads to other parts of the body (<a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=46283\" target=\"_blank\">metastasizes</a>).[4445] In most cases, it has spread by the time it is diagnosed.[4447] A neuroblastoma can cause a variety of signs and symptoms, including a lump where the tumor is growing, bone pain, diarrhea, and various neurological symptoms.[4445][4447] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cause of most neuroblastomas is not known. Rarely, a neuroblastoma is caused by an inherited mutation in a gene, such as the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ALK\" target=\"_blank\">ALK</a></em> gene or&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PHOX2B\" target=\"_blank\">PHOX2B</a></em> gene.[14996] Diagnosing a neuroblastoma may rely on a physical examination, blood tests, imaging tests (such as MRI or CT scan) and ultimately, a biopsy.[4445][4447] Treatment depends on the size and location of the tumor within the body, as well as the child&rsquo;s age. Surgery is often the first step of treatment, and may be followed by <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=45214\" target=\"_blank\">chemotherapy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=44971\" target=\"_blank\">radiation therapy</a>, or a <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=46695\" target=\"_blank\">stem cell transplant</a>&nbsp;in more severe cases.[4447] In some children the tumor goes away without treatment.[4445] While the long-term outlook and chance of survival depends on many factors, the <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/five-year-survival-rate\" target=\"_blank\">5-year survival rate</a> ranges from 40-50% in some, to over 95% in others.
