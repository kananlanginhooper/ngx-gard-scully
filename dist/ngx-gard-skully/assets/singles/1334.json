People with ring chromosome 20 often have recurrent seizures or <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/epilepsy.html\" target=\"_blank\">epilepsy</a>. Other symptoms might include intellectual disability, behavioral difficulties, growth delay, short stature, a small head (<a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/microcephaly/microcephaly.htm\" target=\"_blank\">microcephaly</a>), and characteristic facial features. Ring chromosome 20 is caused by an abnormal chromosome known as a ring chromosome 20 or r(20). A <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/illustrations/ringchromosome\" target=\"_blank\">ring chromosome</a> is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and its broken ends fuse together. Ring chromosome 20 is usually not inherited. It almost always occurs by chance during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development.[10481] Treatment for ring chromosome 20 is focused on management of seizures and accommodations for learning.[10480]<br />","dateModified":"2016-01-26T16:10:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":10026,"questionText":"How might ring chromosome 20 be treated?","answerText":"Treatment of ring chromosome 20 is typically focused on management of seizures. The seizures associated with ring chromosome 20 do not generally respond well to medications.&nbsp;The treatment that is&nbsp;successful varies from person to person. &lsquo;Broad spectrum&rsquo; anti-epileptic drugs are usually tried first since they are active against different seizure types. Examples include <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682412.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">valproate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a699059.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">levetiracetam</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a695007.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">lamotrigine</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a697012.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">topiramate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a603008.html\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">zonisamide</a>.

The long-term effectiveness of VNS therapy is not yet known.[10480]","dateModified":"2016-01-26T15:38:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":10480,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Ring 20","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Unique","date":"2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.rarechromo.org/information/Chromosome%2020/Ring%2020%20FTNW.pdf","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
