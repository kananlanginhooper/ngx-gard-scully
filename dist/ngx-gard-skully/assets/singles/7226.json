Nervous system and behavioral disturbances also occur, such as involuntary muscle movements and self injury (including biting and head banging).

Depending on each person's individual situation and choices, this may be accomplished either during a pregnancy, or before a pregnancy begins.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo find out whether a fetus is affected during a pregnancy, prenatal testing can be performed either by molecular genetic testing or biochemical genetic testing. Molecular genetic testing may be done if the specific mutation in the <em>HPRT1</em> gene has been identified in the family. The usual procedure is to first determine fetal sex by performing chromosome analysis on fetal cells obtained by <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003406.htm\" target=\"_blank\">chorionic villus sampling</a> (at about 10 to 12 weeks gestation), or by <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003921.htm\" target=\"_blank\">amniocentesis</a> (usually performed at about 15 to 18 weeks gestation). If the fetus is known to be male, DNA from fetal cells can then be tested for the mutation in the family. If the specific mutation in the <em>HPRT1</em> gene in the family is not known, biochemical genetic testing is preferred. This testing also requires either chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, but involves measuring HPRT enzyme activity in the cells obtained during the procedure. If Lesch Nyhan syndrome is confirmed in the fetus by either method of testing, pregnancy options including pregnancy termination may be discussed with a health care provider.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs an alternative to prenatal diagnosis during the pregnancy, <a href=\"http://americanpregnancy.org/infertility/preimplantationgeneticdiagnosis.html\" target=\"_blank\">preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD)</a> <em>before</em> a pregnancy may be available if the mutation in the family is known.
