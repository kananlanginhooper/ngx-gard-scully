Unlike the other forms of galactosemia, most affected infants do not develop any concerning signs or symptoms even when breastfed or on a galactose-containing formula. Some may develop <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/jaundice.html\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">jaundice</a>, but this symptom typically resolves quickly when the baby is switched to a low-galactose formula. Duarte galactosemia is caused by changes (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>) in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GALT\" target=\"_blank\">GALT</a></em> gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> manner. People with Duarte galactosemia, specifically, typically have one severe <em>GALT</em> gene mutation and one milder <em>GALT</em> gene mutation, known as the \"Duarte variant.\" Experts disagree regarding the risks and long-term complications of Duarte galactosemia and whether or not dietary interventions are needed. As a result, there is no standard treatment for infants with the condition. Some healthcare providers recommend partial to complete dietary restriction of milk and other high galactose foods for affected infants, but others do not.[10518][10519][10520]","dateModified":"2016-02-01T13:42:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":13639,"relatedDiseaseName":"Classic galactosemia","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":2424,"relatedDiseaseName":"Galactosemia","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
