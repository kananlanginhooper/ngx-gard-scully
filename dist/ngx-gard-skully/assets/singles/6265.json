It primarily affects children and young adults and is more common in males.  It is formed by small, round cancer cells surrounded by scar-like tissue and is often found in the tissue (peritoneum) that lines the inside of the abdomen and pelvis. The tumor cells have a characteristic genetic change involving a <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=470251\" target=\"_blank\">translocation</a> between <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/11\" target=\"_blank\">chromosomes 11</a> and <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/22\" target=\"_blank\">22</a>, which is important in differentiating from other similar tumors. The genetic change involved in DSRCT is acquired throughout a person's lifetime and is not inherited.[12171][12172][12173]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSymptoms may include abdominal pain and a feeling of fullness, abdominal mass, and symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction, such as constipation.
