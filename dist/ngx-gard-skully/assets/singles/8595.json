Symptoms of AVED include slurred speech (<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007470.htm\" target=\"_blank\">dysarthria</a>), difficulty coordinating movements (<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003198.htm\" target=\"_blank\">ataxia</a>), numbness in the hands and feet (<a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-neuropathy/basics/definition/CON-20019948?p=1\" target=\"_blank\">peripheral neuropathy</a>), and progressive leg weakness.

Symptoms typically begin during childhood or adolescence and worsen with age, resulting in the need for a wheelchair by early adulthood. AVED is caused by a mutation to the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TTPA\" target=\"_blank\">TTPA</a></em> gene. When this <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a>  is damaged, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002406.htm\" target=\"_blank\">vitamin E</a> cannot be distributed throughout the body.

AVED is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>  manner. Treatment for AVED includes vitamin E supplements, which will prevent AVED from developing if given before symptoms begin and may reverse some neurological symptoms if begun after AVED develops.[11831][11832]","dateModified":"2016-07-10T15:46:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":11331,"questionText":"How is ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED) diagnosed?","answerText":"AVED may be suspected in individuals who have the following findings at the beginning of puberty:[11832]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Progressive ataxia</li>\r\n    <li>Clumsiness of the hands</li>\r\n    <li>Loss of the ability to know where one's body is in space (proprioception)</li>\r\n    <li>Absent reflexes (areflexia)</li>\r\n    <li>The inability to perform rapid, alternating movements (dysdiadochokinesia)</li>\r\n    <li>A tendency to sway or fall while standing upright with the feet together, arms stretched out and the eyes closed (positive Romberg sign)</li>\r\n    <li>A nodding movement of the head (titubation)</li>\r\n    <li>Decreased visual sharpness (acuity)</li>\r\n    <li>Positive <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003294.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Babinski sign</a> (upward movement of the big toe and fanning of the feet after the sole of the foot has been firmly stroked)</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://lookafteryoureyes.org/how-your-eyes-work/parts-of-the-eye/macula/\" target=\"_blank\">Macular</a> atrophy (wasting away of the cells that form the part of our eye responsible for central vision)</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001029.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Retinitis pigmentosa</a>&nbsp;(eye disease in which there is damage to the retina)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLaboratory studies typically show a reduced plasma vitamin E concentration but normal levels of lipoproteins (proteins that combine with and transport fat or other lipids in the blood).
