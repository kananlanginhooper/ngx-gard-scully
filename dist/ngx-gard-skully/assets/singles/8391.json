It is&nbsp;caused by mutations in the <span class=\"geneSymbol\"><em><a href=\"http://www.ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/OTC\" target=\"_blank\">OTC</a></em></span> gene. This gene gives the body&nbsp;instructions for making the OTC enzyme.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe urea cycle is a chain of reactions in liver cells, which processes the nitrogen that is left over when protein is used by the body. It uses the nitrogen to make  urea, which is then eliminated by the kidneys. The OTC enzyme is needed for a specific reaction in the urea cycle. Mutations in the OTC gene impair the OTC enzyme's ability to function. This causes nitrogen to build up in the blood, in the form of ammonia. The toxicity of the ammonia in the blood damages the nervous system and causes the features of OTC deficiency.[7149]","dateModified":"2017-07-21T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":7149,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ornithine-transcarbamylase-deficiency","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":4152,"questionText":"How is ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency inherited?","answerText":"OTC deficiency follows&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002051.htm\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked</a> inheritance.[7149] This is because the gene responsible for causing OTC deficiency is located on the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/X\" target=\"_blank\">X chromosome</a>, one of the two sex chromosomes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nX-linked diseases more commonly occur in males, who have only one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome). Having a mutation in a gene on their X chromosome is enough to cause the disease. Females have two X chromosomes, so if they have a mutation on one of them, they still have one X chromosome without the mutation and are much less likely to have the disease. In some cases however, females with only one mutation in the OTC gene will have symptoms of OTC deficiency.
