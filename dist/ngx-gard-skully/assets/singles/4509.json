Although it is a benign tumor, PTT may be locally aggressive and in very rare cases the tumor may become malignant. In most cases there is only one lesion and occur in elderly women.[10345][10346] The tumor is not painful but sometimes they may grow very large and pressure and damage the skin around it resulting in wounds and foul-smelling discharge. About 90% of the cases are on the scalp, but they have also been found on the forehead, nose, back, chest, abdomen, buttocks, elbow, wrist and genitalia.[10347] Treatment is with surgery removing the lesion. Prognosis is good in most cases but the patient should be followed closely after surgery.[10346]","dateModified":"2016-01-06T10:33:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
