This can impact all the organs and tissues, but mainly affects the kidneys and eyes. There are three types of cystinosis based on the age that symptoms start. The most common is the type that starts in infancy. Early symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, and dehydration. If left untreated, cystinosis leads to kidney and eye damage which gets worse over time. The adult form of cystinosis primarily affects the eyes, causing light sensitivity. Cystinosis is caused by genetic changes (<a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/776887\" target=\"_blank\">DNA variants)</a> in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CTNS\" target=\"_blank\">CTNS</a></em> gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> pattern. It is diagnosed by checking for cystine levels in the blood, by genetic testing, or by an eye examination. Treatment is available using medications that absorb extra cystine from the body.
