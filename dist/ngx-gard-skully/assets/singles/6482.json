By age 35 years, 95% of affected people have polyps. Once they appear, the polyps rapidly increase in number. Without colectomy, hundreds to thousands of colon polyps are typically observed and colon cancer is inevitable. The average age of colon cancer diagnosis in untreated individuals is 39 years (range 34-43 years).[7935] However, with early diagnosis and high-risk management, the prognosis is good. In fact, the 5-year survival rate for patients who undergo <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007380.htm\" target=\"_blank\">protocolectomy</a> is nearly 100%. If alternative surgeries are performed that remove the colon but not the rectum, the recurrence rate is 30% in 20 years and 45% in 30 years; continued surveillance of the remaining rectum is, therefore, imperative.[8115] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe skin abnormalities (<a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sebaceous-cysts/basics/definition/CON-20031599?p=1\" target=\"_blank\">epidermoid cysts</a>, fibromas, and <a href=\"http://www.dermnetnz.org/lesions/lipoma.html\" target=\"_blank\">lipomas</a>) associated with Gardner syndrome are mainly of cosmetic concern, as they do not appear to become malignant (cancerous). Osteomas (bony growths) do not usually cause medical problems and do not become malignant. Although <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/desmoid-tumor\" target=\"_blank\">desmoid tumors</a> are typically benign (noncancerous), they have a tendency to invade surrounding tissues and/or compress nearby organs and can be very difficult to remove.[7935]","dateModified":"2015-01-15T09:50:00","resourceClassificationName":"Prognosis","references":[{"referenceId":7935,"authors":"Kory W Jasperson, MS and Randall W Burt, MD","articleTitle":"APC-Associated Polyposis Conditions","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"March 27, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1345/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8115,"authors":"Hemant Singhal, MD, MBBS, FRCSEd, FRCS(C)","articleTitle":"Gardner syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"June 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/190486-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":6408,"relatedDiseaseName":"Familial adenomatous polyposis","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
