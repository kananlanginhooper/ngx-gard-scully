In gastroparesis,&nbsp; the muscles of the stomach do not work well and digestion takes an abnormally long time. Symptoms of gastroparesis include bloating, nausea, vomiting, weight loss due to poor absorption of nutrients, early fullness while eating meals, heartburn, and abdominal pain. Complications can occur including dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, blood sugar abnormalities, malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pepticulcer.html\" target=\"_blank\">stomach ulcers</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/gerd.html\" target=\"_blank\">gastroesophageal reflux</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001153.htm\" target=\"_blank\">esophagitis</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000222.htm\" target=\"_blank\">small bowel bacterial overgrowth</a>, and metabolic bone disease.&nbsp; In rare cases, food that is poorly digested can collect in the stomach and form  a bezoar, a mass of undigested material that can cause a blockage in the gastrointestinal tract. Gastroparesis is more common in people with diabetes and those who have had recent stomach or intestinal surgery.[14538][14539]<span>&nbsp; </span>Other causes include infections, hormonal disorders like hypothyroidism, connective tissue disorders like <a href=\"http://www.scleroderma.org/site/PageNavigator/patients_whatis.html#.WtDoHi7wapo\" target=\"_blank\">scleroderma</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/autoimmunediseases.html\" target=\"_blank\">autoimmune conditions</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/neuromusculardisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">neuromuscular diseases</a>, psychological conditions, and eating disorders.

However, many others are so severely affected that they are not able to perform normal activities of daily living, and may have a decreased quality of life and significant psychological distress.[14540][14626][14627]. Studies evaluating the quality of life of individuals with gastroparesis have reported decreased physical and social functioning and reduced overall well-being.[14628] About 1 in 10 patients with gastroparesis is considered disabled. Studies have also shown that patients with gastroparesis have significantly reduced overall survival when compared with the general population.[13648][14629]</span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">Multiple symptoms can be associated with gastroparesis. With the delay in gastric emptying, affected individuals commonly suffer from nausea (93 percent), vomiting (68 to 84 percent), and abdominal pain (46 to 90 percent).[13648] The abdominal pain interferes with sleep in 80 percent of patients.[13648]<strong> </strong>Patients also experience<strong> </strong>bloating,<strong> </strong>early fullness while eating, and loss of appetite.</span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">As a result of the recurrent vomiting and decreased oral intake, patients with gastroparesis can develop dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities including low potassium levels and imbalances in the acid/base status of the blood. Blood sugar (glucose) levels fluctuate and are difficult to control, particularly in patients with diabetes. Malnutrition and unintentional weight loss can occur because patients eat fewer calories and absorb vitamins and nutrients poorly, and often require hydration and vitamin and nutritional supplementation. Emergency room visits and long, costly hospitalizations to provide hydration and nutritional support are common among these patients.[14630] Nutrition is often delivered directly into the intestines through feeding tubes, and in rare&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">severe cases it may be necessary to deliver it directly into the blood.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">Other complications are also associated with gastroparesis. </span><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000222.htm\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">Small bowel bacterial overgrowth</span></a><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"> (often called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or SIBO) may worsen the digestive symptoms, malnutrition, and vitamin deficiencies; therefore, it is important to monitor for the overgrowth and to treat as necessary.[14540][14626] Decreased intake of calcium and vitamin D and poor absorption can lead to metabolic bone disease.[14626] Secondary gastrointestinal complications can develop such as </span><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/gerd.html\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">gastroesophageal reflux</span></a><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">, </span><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pepticulcer.html\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">stomach ulcers</span></a><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">, </span><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001153.htm\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">esophagitis</span></a><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">, and </span><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000269.htm\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">tears of the esophagus</span></a><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">.[14630] Some patients with gastroparesis are also at increased risk of blood clots.</span><br />\r\n</span><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">In rare, </span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">severe cases of gastroparesis, patients may develop a bezoar, a mass of poorly digested food that forms in the stomach. This mass may cause a blockage that prevents the stomach contents from emptying into the small intestine, and affected individuals may experience worsening of their nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.[14630][14626][14631] It is estimated that 6 percent of gastroparesis patients develop a bezoar, and gastroparesis is the single most common cause of bezoar formation.[14631][14632]</span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">Although many people can live a relatively normal life with proper management of gastroparesis, some of the medical treatments are not tolerated by patients, and management options are limited.[14633] However, new medications and surgical techniques may provide some relief for difficult-to-treat symptoms in the future.[14630][14633] </span><br />\r\n<div id=\"_com_1\" language=\"JavaScript\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<br />\r\n<div id=\"_com_1\" language=\"JavaScript\">&nbsp;</div>","dateModified":"2018-05-15T10:21:00","resourceClassificationName":"Prognosis","references":[{"referenceId":13648,"authors":"Camilleri M","articleTitle":"Gastroparesis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosi","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"June, 2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroparesis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"Waltham, MA","publisher":"UpToDate"},{"referenceId":14538,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Gastroparesis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases","date":"","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/gastroparesis/definition-facts","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14539,"authors":"Fox J & Foxx-Orenstein A","articleTitle":"Gastroparesis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"American College of Gastroenterology","date":"December 2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://patients.gi.org/topics/gastroparesis/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14540,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Gastroparesis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Organization for Rare Diseases  (NORD)","date":"2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/gastroparesis/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14625,"authors":"Bharadwaj S., Meka K., Tandon P., et.al.","articleTitle":"Management of gastroparesis-associated malnutrition","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J.
