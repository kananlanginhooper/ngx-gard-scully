When the lungs are involved, systemic sclerosis often causes interstitial lung disease and/or pulmonary arterial hypertension. Additional lung complications and conditions can also occur in association with systemic sclerosis. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nInterstitial lung disease refers to scarring in the lungs which can make the lungs stiff and make it hard to breathe. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is high blood pressure in the blood vessels in the lungs. This high blood pressure can put strain on the heart.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOptions for pulmonary arterial hypertension treatment aims to reduce the strain on your heart. Treatment options include medications, such as endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, prostacyclins, anticoagulants<strong>, </strong>calcium channel blockers,diuretics<strong>, </strong>and inhaled oxygen. Some people with pulmonary arterial hypertension undergo surgery, such as lung transplantation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can read this an much more at the following link to the American Lung Association: <a href=\"http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension/symptoms-diagnosis.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.lung.org/lung-disease/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension/symptoms-diagnosis.html</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nOptions for interstitial lung disease treatment aims to make breathing more productive, reduce inflammation, and suppress overactive immune systems. Treatment options include medications, such as Mycophenolate (CellCept&reg;) or Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan&reg;).
