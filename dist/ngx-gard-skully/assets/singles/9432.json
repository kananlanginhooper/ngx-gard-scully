It is often caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Genetic factors involve genes that code for proteins that help control the complement system (part of your body’s immune system). Environmental factors include viral or bacterial infections, certain medications (such as anticancer drugs), chronic diseases,&nbsp;cancers, and organ transplantation. &nbsp;Most cases are <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/sporadic/\" target=_blank>sporadic</a>.
