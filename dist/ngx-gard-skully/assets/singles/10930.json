It is most common in the stomach but can occur in other locations, including the <a href=\"https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/digestive/regions/intestine.html\" target=\"_blank\">small and large intestine</a>. Dieulafoy lesions can cause severe and sudden <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/gastrointestinalbleeding.html\" target=\"_blank\">gastrointestinal bleeding</a>.[12792][12793] The condition occurs in people of all ages, but is more common in males than in females.[12793]&nbsp;Depending upon the site of the bleeding, symptoms may include vomiting up blood (hematemesis); sticky, dark-colored stools (melena); passage of fresh blood in the stool (hematochezia); or coughing up blood (hemoptysis). Some affected individuals may only present with blood pressure problems.[12793][12794] Treatment may include endoscopic and/or surgical techniques. Though treatment can be effective, Dieulafoy lesions and the associated blood loss can be fatal, especially if not diagnosed and treated promptly.[12794][12795]","dateModified":"2016-12-16T13:24:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":11460,"questionText":"What causes&nbsp;Dieulafoy lesion?","answerText":"Dieulafoy lesions may not cause symptoms until the lining of the stomach or intestine wears away, exposing the artery.
