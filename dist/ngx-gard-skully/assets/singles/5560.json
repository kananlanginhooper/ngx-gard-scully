The few patients described in the medical literature were characterized by brain anomalies; an unusual face with broad nasal root, widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), and a very small chin (micrognathia); failure to thrive; severe <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001523.htm\" target=\"_blank\">intellectual disability</a>;&nbsp;and lack of muscle tone (hypotonia).  Exams of the brain showed poor development (hypoplasia) of the pale part of the brain known as <a href=\"http://umm.edu/health/medical/ency/images/gray-and-white-matter-of-the-brain\" target=\"_blank\">white matter</a>, and an absent or abnormal <a href=\"http://cnsvp.stanford.edu/atlas/images/corpus.JPG\" target=\"_blank\">corpus callosum</a>&nbsp;(nerve fibers joining the two hemispheres of the brain).  Only a few cases have been described.  The cause is unknown but may be related to a disorder of <a href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/cells.html\" target=\"_blank\">axonal</a> development. &nbsp;The described cases seem to be inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>  or <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=209\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked</a>  way.

It can be either asymptomatic or associated with intellectual disability, <a href=\"http://www.epilepsy.com/learn/epilepsy-101/what-epilepsy\" target=\"_blank\">epilepsy</a>, or psychiatric syndromes. It can be part of several genetic syndromes, such as <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/aicardi-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Aicardi syndrome</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/1537/andermann-syndrome/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">Andermann syndrome</a> and <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/5833/apert-syndrome/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">Apert syndrome</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/7341/trisomy-13/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">trisomies 13</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/6321/trisomy-18/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">18</a>; or result from metabolic causes; drugs (cocaine); or viral infection (influenza). Many patients with corpus callosum anomalies have other brain anomalies, including white matter hypoplasia.
