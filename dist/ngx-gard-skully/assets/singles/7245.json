The <em>PABPN1</em> gene provides instructions for making the PABPN1 protein that is active (expressed) throughout the body. In cells, the PABPN1 protein plays an important role in processing molecules called messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which serve as genetic blueprints for making proteins. The protein acts to protect the mRNA from being broken down and allows it to move within the cell.[835][955] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <em>PABPN1</em> gene contains a section of DNA called a GCN repeat, which normally repeats around 10 times. In cases of OPMD, this section of DNA is repeated 11-17 times. This results in the protein having too many of an amino acid called alanine. The extra alanine causes the PABPN1 protein to form clumps within muscle cells that cannot be broken down. These clumps are thought to impair the normal function of muscle cells and eventually cause cells to die. The progressive loss of muscle cells most likely causes the muscle weakness seen in people with OPMD. It is not known why abnormal PABPN1 proteins seem to affect muscle cells in only certain parts of the body.[835][955]","dateModified":"2016-06-15T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":835,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"December 2008","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/oculopharyngeal-muscular-dystrophy","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":955,"authors":"Trollet C, Gidaro T, Klein P, et al","articleTitle":"Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"Februaru 20, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1126/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":1389,"questionText":"How is oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) inherited?","answerText":"Most cases of OPMD are inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner, which means one copy of the altered (mutated)&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a> in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.[835][955] Individuals have two copies of each gene; one copy having been inherited from each parent.

These clumps are thought to impair the normal function of muscle cells and eventually cause cells to die. The progressive loss of muscle cells most likely causes the muscle weakness seen in people with OPMD. It is not known why abnormal PABPN1 proteins seem to affect muscle cells in only certain parts of the body.[835][955]","dateModified":"2016-06-15T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":835,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"December 2008","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/oculopharyngeal-muscular-dystrophy","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":955,"authors":"Trollet C, Gidaro T, Klein P, et al","articleTitle":"Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"Februaru 20, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1126/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":1389,"questionText":"How is oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) inherited?","answerText":"Most cases of OPMD are inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner, which means one copy of the altered (mutated)&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a> in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.[835][955] Individuals have two copies of each gene; one copy having been inherited from each parent. An individual with the autosomal dominant form of OPMD may have inherited the condition from an affected parent, or less commonly, the condition may occur for the first time in the affected individual. Each child of an affected individual with this form of OPMD has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be affected and a 50% chance to be unaffected.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLess commonly,&nbsp;OPMD is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> manner, which means that both copies of the disease-causing gene in each cell must have a mutation for an individual to be affected. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene (and are referred to as carriers), but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.[835] When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to be unaffected <em>and</em> not be a carrier. The children of an individual with autosomal recessive OPMD will always be carriers (obligate heterozygotes) for the disease-causing mutation. The risk of a child being affected if his/her parent has autosomal recessive OPMD is less than 1%.[955]","dateModified":"2016-06-15T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[{"referenceId":835,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"December 2008","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/oculopharyngeal-muscular-dystrophy","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":955,"authors":"Trollet C, Gidaro T, Klein P, et al","articleTitle":"Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"Februaru 20, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1126/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":1390,"questionText":"Can the symptoms of&nbsp;oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) occur at earlier ages in subsequent generations (known as anticipation)?","answerText":"Families with OPMD showing earlier onset of symptoms in subsequent generations have not been reported in the medical literature.
