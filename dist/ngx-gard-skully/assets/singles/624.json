The eye abnormalities seen in this condition seldom lead to vision loss.

These genes each provide instructions for making one component of a protein called type IV collagen, which plays an important role in the glomeruli of the kidneys. Glomeruli are clusters of specialized blood vessels that remove water and waste products from the blood and create urine. Mutations in the genes associated with Alport syndrome result in abnormalities of the type IV collagen in glomeruli, which prevent the kidneys from properly filtering the blood. As a result, blood and protein pass into the urine. Over time, the kidneys become scarred, which leads to kidney failure.[3321][6126]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nType IV collagen is also an important component of the organ of Corti, the inner ear structure that transforms sound waves into nerve impulses for the brain. Alterations in type IV collagen may result in abnormal inner ear functions, which can lead to hearing loss. In addition, type IV collagen plays a role in the eye, where it helps maintain the shape of the lens and the cells of the retina. Mutations found in Alport syndrome may affect the retina and the shape of the lens.[3321]&nbsp;<br />","dateModified":"2017-03-18T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":3321,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Alport syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"December 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/alport-syndrome","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":6126,"authors":"Meroni M and Sessa A","articleTitle":"Alport syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet","date":"July 2007","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?Lng=EN&Expert=63","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":5539,"questionText":"How is Alport syndrome inherited?","answerText":"Alport syndrome can be inherited in three different ways.

The <em>COL4A5</em> gene is located on the X <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/chromosome\">chromosome</a>, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the <em>COL4A5</em> gene in each cell is sufficient to cause kidney failure and other severe symptoms of the disorder. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in only one copy of the <em>COL4A5</em> gene usually only results in hematuria. However, some women experience more severe symptoms such as kidney failure or hearing loss. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.[3321]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn approximately 15 percent of cases, Alport syndrome results from mutations in both copies of the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/COL4A3\"><em>COL4A3</em></a> or <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/COL4A4\"><em>COL4A4</em></a> gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002052.htm\">autosomal recessive</a> pattern.
