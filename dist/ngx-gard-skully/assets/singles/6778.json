The growths become&nbsp;swirled grey or brown patches in childhood, and then swirled light patches in adulthood. Other signs and symptoms may include hair loss, small or missing teeth,&nbsp;eye abnormalities that can lead to vision loss, and lined or pitted nails. Most people with IP have normal intelligence, but some have developmental delay,&nbsp;intellectual disability, seizures, and/or other neurological problems. IP is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IKBKG\" target=\"_blank\">IKBKG</a> </em>gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002050.htm\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked dominant</a>&nbsp;manner.[3308]","dateModified":"2014-07-29T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":7501,"questionText":"How is incontinentia pigmenti inherited?","answerText":"Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.genetics.edu.au/Publications-and-Resources/Genetics-Fact-Sheets/FactSheet10A\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked dominant</a>&nbsp;manner. The gene responsible for causing IP (<em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IKBKG\" target=\"_blank\">IKBKG</a></em>) is on the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/X\" target=\"_blank\">X chromosome</a> (one of the two sex chromosomes), which is why the condition is \"X-linked.\" The condition is dominant because in females, who have two X chromosomes, having a mutation in only one copy of the responsible gene is enough to cause the condition.[3308]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn males, who have only one X chromosome, most <em>IKBKG</em> mutations result in a total loss of the protein for which the gene provides instructions. Males don't have another X chromosome with a working copy of the gene. When there is no working copy of this gene, IP is lethal in early development. This is why so few males are born with IP. Males living with this condition may have an <em>IKBKG</em> mutation with a mild effect; a mutation in only some of the body's cells (mosaicism); or an extra copy of the X chromosome in each cell.[3308]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome people with IP inherit an <em>IKBKG</em> mutation from a parent with the condition, while other cases are due to new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the condition in their family.[3308] When a female with IP has children, each female child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated gene. If a male is conceived, there is a 50% risk to be unaffected and a 50% risk to be affected and likely miscarry.","dateModified":"2014-07-29T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[{"referenceId":3308,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Incontinentia pigmenti","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"June 2008","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/incontinentia-pigmenti","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":11139,"questionText":"How might incontinentia pigmenti be treated?","answerText":"There is no specific treatment for incontinentia pigmenti.
