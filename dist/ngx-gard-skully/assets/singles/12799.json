In general, Alzheimer disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the brain that causes gradual loss of memory, judgement and the ability to function socially. The exact underlying cause of late-onset familial AD is not completely understood; however, researchers suspect that it is a <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/complexdisorders\" target=\"_blank\">complex condition</a>, which is likely associated with multiple susceptibility genes in combination with environmental and lifestyle factors.[127] A gene called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/APOE\"><span aria-label=\"A P O E\"><em>APOE</em></span></a>&nbsp;has been studied extensively as a risk factor for the disease.
