Signs and symptoms occur as the result of a deficiency in the blood clotting factor 13, which is responsible for stabilizing the formation of a blood clot. In affected individuals, the blood fails to clot appropriately, resulting in poor wound healing. Blood may seep into surrounding soft tissues, resulting in local pain and swelling. Internal bleeding may occur;&nbsp;about&nbsp;25 percent of affected individuals experience bleeding in the brain.[4095] FXIII deficiency is usually caused by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\" target=_blank>mutations</a> in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/F13A1\" target=_blank><em>F13A1</em></a> gene, but mutations have also been found in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/F13B\" target=_blank>F13B</a></em> gene.
