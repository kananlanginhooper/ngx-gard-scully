Less commonly, ANFH can occur as the result of trauma to the hip, such as a hip fracture or hip surgery. Around 20,000-30,000 cases are reported each year in the United States. This condition mainly affects young, active adults, but can occur in children as well. In children, ANFH is known as Legg-Calves-Perthes disease. Most people with ANFH do not have a family history of this condition, but there are some very rare inherited forms of ANFH.[15250][15251]<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\nANFH is usually diagnosed by X-rays or an MRI.
