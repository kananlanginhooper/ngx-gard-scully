Type I progresses quickly (within days), leading to <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000500.htm\" target=\"_blank\">kidney failure</a>. Individuals with type I typically have dramatically reduced urine output, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003103.htm\" target=\"_blank\">edema</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000210.htm\" target=\"_blank\">jaundice</a>, and often suffer from <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000302.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hepatic encephalopathy</a>. Type II progresses more slowly, over weeks or months, and the symptoms are less severe. The cause of hepatorenal syndrome is unknown. A contributing factor seems to be a narrowing of the blood vessels that connect into the kidneys. This causes a decrease in blood flow to the kidneys, impairing their function.[11851] In some cases, triggers or precipitating factors (infections, blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract, low blood pressure) are involved. Treatment is aimed at helping the liver work better and maintaining kidney function.[11851][11852] In many cases, a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003006.htm\" target=\"_blank\">liver transplant</a> is needed.[11851][11853] In some cases, individuals also need a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003005.htm\" target=\"_blank\">kidney transplant</a>.[11851]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2016-07-13T20:40:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
