The resulting ring may be missing genes, or it may contain extra copies of genes. Therefore, the severity and symptoms associated with ring chromosome 9 vary from person to person. Signs and symptoms that may be present in a person with ring chromosome 9 include slow growth and short stature, learning disabilities, small head size, distinctive facial features, low muscle tone (hypotonia), skeletal abnormalities, and/or other birth defects involving various parts of the body. However, people with ring chromosome 9 can be generally healthy and have no major birth defects.[14668]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRing chromosome 9 typically is not inherited and occurs sporadically, during the formation of egg or sperm cells or shortly after the egg and sperm join together. Occasionally, one of the parents has a chromosome abnormality involving chromosome 9. Chromosome testing of both parents can help determine whether the ring chromosome was inherited and whether future children have an increased chance to have a chromosome abnormality.[14668] Treatment for ring chromosome 9 depends on the signs and symptoms present in each person.</span>","dateModified":"2018-05-29T09:53:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
