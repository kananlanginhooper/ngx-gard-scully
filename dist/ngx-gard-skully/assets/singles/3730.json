The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with chromosome 1p deletion include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and distinctive facial features.[8857] Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the deletion on to their children. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.","dateModified":"2015-05-07T19:51:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":6082,"relatedDiseaseName":"Chromosome 1p36 deletion syndrome","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
