[12113][12114] Symptoms may include fever, runny nose, and cough. HPIV-3 can also cause <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000975.htm\" target=\"_blank\">bronchiolitis</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/acutebronchitis.html\" target=\"_blank\">bronchitis</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pneumonia.html\" target=\"_blank\">pneumonia</a>. Infants and young children are particularly susceptible to HPIV-3 infections, though older adults and those with a weakened immune system are also at risk for complications.[12113][12114] HPIVs are usually spread from an infected person to others through coughing, sneezing, and/or touching.[12115] There is currently no vaccine to protect against parainfluenza virus infections. Most HPIV infections resolve on their own and do not require special treatment, though medical intervention may be necessary for severe breathing problems. [12116][12117][12118] Most adults have antibodies against parainfluenza but can get repeat infections.[12116]","dateModified":"2016-08-30T17:11:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
