People with neuroferritinopathy have progressive problems with movement that begin at about age 40. These movement problems can include involuntary jerking motions (<a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/chorea/chorea.htm\" target=_blank>chorea</a>), rhythmic shaking (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003192.htm\" target=_blank>tremor</a>), difficulty coordinating movements (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003198.htm\" target=_blank>ataxia</a>), or uncontrolled tensing of muscles (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/dystonia.html\" target=_blank>dystonia</a>). Symptoms of the disorder may be more prominent on one side of the body. Affected individuals may also have difficulty swallowing (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007543.htm\" target=_blank>dysphagia</a>) and speaking (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007470.htm\" target=_blank>dysarthria</a>).
