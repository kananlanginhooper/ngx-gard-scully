This gene, located on chromosome&nbsp;14q12, provides instructions for making a protein known as the cardiac beta (&#946;)-myosin heavy chain. This protein is found in heart (cardiac) muscle and in type I skeletal muscle fibers. Type I fibers, which are also known as slow-twitch fibers, are one of two types of fibers that make up skeletal muscles. Type I fibers are the primary component of skeletal muscles that are resistant to fatigue. For example, muscles involved in posture, such as the neck muscles that hold the head steady, are made predominantly of type I fibers.[5393]","dateModified":"2012-08-09T15:10:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":5393,"authors":"","articleTitle":"MYH7","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"2008","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MYH7","dateAccessed":"2012-08-09T00:00:00"}]},{"questionId":6341,"questionText":"How might scapuloperoneal myopathy be treated?","answerText":"There is no standard course of treatment for scapuloperoneal myopathy.&nbsp;Some patients may benefit from&nbsp;physical therapy or other therapeutic exercises.[5391] ","dateModified":"2012-08-09T15:11:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":5391,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Scapuloperoneal myopathy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)","date":"2007","url":"http://www.rarediseases.org/rare-disease-information/rare-diseases/byID/436/viewAbstract","dateAccessed":"2012-08-09T00:00:00"}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":7922,"relatedDiseaseName":"Muscular dystrophy","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12831,"relatedDiseaseName":"Myosinopathies","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
