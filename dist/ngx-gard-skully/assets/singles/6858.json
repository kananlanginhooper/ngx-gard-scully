People with LCH produce too many Langerhans cells or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002374.htm\" target=\"_blank\">histiocytes</a>, a form of white blood cell found in&nbsp;healthy people that is supposed&nbsp;to protect the body from infection. In people with LCH,&nbsp;these cells multiply excessively and build up in certain areas of the body, causing tumors called&nbsp;granulomas to form.[536]&nbsp;The symptoms of LCH vary from person to person, depending on the areas of the body affected. LCH may be found in many areas of the body, including but not limited to the skin and nails, mouth, bones, lymph nodes, pituitary gland, and thyroid gland. When it is found in multiple areas of the body, it is known as multisystem disease.[536][13283] The cause of this disease is unknown, although most data suggest that it is characterized by a growth of immature Langerhans cells that appear to have mutations of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/116/11/1825.full.pdf+html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>BRAF</em></a>&nbsp;gene in about half the cases. LCH is not caused by a known infection, is not contagious, nor is it believed to be inherited. There remain differing opinions among experts as to whether it is definitively a cancer or not.[536][2053] Treatment for LCH varies and may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and use of certain medications.[2053][13283]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLHC includes four variants, with different degrees of severity:[536][13283][2053]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/2604/hashimoto-pritzker-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Hashimoto-Pritzker disease</a>, a congenital self-healing form</li>\r\n    <li>Letterer-Siwe disease,&nbsp;&nbsp;a severe, acute and disseminate form&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Hand-Sch&uuml;ller-Christian disease, &nbsp;an intermediate chronic form with multiple lesions&nbsp;characterized by diabetes insipidus, bulging of the eye and localized lesions in the bone</li>\r\n    <li>Eosinophilic granuloma, a less severe form, characterized by&nbsp;solitary or few, and chronic lesions of bone or other organs.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBecause all the variants have many common symptoms it is thought that they may be manifestations of LCH and not separate syndromes.[536][13283][2053]","dateModified":"2017-09-11T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":1886,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Langerhans cell histiocytosis?","answerText":"Symptoms of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) can vary greatly from person to person depending on how much of the body is involved and what part(s) are affected. The disease can affect virtually every organ, including skin, bones, lymph nodes, bone marrow, liver, spleen, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, thymus, central nervous system, and hormone glands. The symptoms may range from localized bone lesions or skin disease to multiple organ involvement and severe dysfunction.[1155]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBelow are the organs that may be affected as well as the symptoms that might be observed:[1155]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Skin - </strong>Red, scaly papules in areas where opposing skin surfaces touch or rub (e.g. skin folds) are commonly seen in LCH. Infants with the skin presentation on the scalp are often misdiagnosed with cradle cap. The skin symptoms usually improve without treatment.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li><strong>Bone</strong> - Lesions that cause bone destruction are common, with the skull, lower limbs, ribs, pelvis, and vertebrae usually being affected. Symptoms may include pain, swelling, limited motion, and inability to bear weight.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li><strong>Lymph node </strong>- Lymph node involvement may be limited or associated with a skin or bone lesion or disseminated disease. Although any of the lymph nodes may be affected, the cervical lymph nodes are where the disease commonly occurs. Individuals usually only present with pain of the lymph node affected. If only one lymph node is affected, prognosis is normally good and treatment is unnecessary.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li><strong>Liver</strong> - Liver involvement at the time of diagnosis is generally associated with more severe disease. Symptoms may include ascites, jaundice, low levels of protein, and prolonged clotting time.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li><strong>Central nervous system (CNS) and hormone </strong>- CNS involvement is rare and may be devastating. The most common result of CNS involvement is the altering of hormonal function, with some individuals developing diabetes insipidus. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.histio.org/page.aspx?pid=380\" target=\"_blank\">More detailed information about the symptoms of&nbsp;LCH can be accessed through the Histiocytosis Association's website</a>.</p>\r\nIn adults with LCH, the lung is the most frequently involved organ system, and solitary lung lesions may be the only symptom.

Somatic gene mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime, which means they are acquired after conception and are only present in certain cells. Because they are not present in the germ cells (egg and sperm), they are not passed on to the next generation (are not inherited).[13803]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <em>BRAF</em> gene provides instructions for making a protein that is normally switched on and off in response to signals that control cell growth and development. Somatic mutations cause the BRAF protein in affected cells to be continuously on and to transmit messages to the nucleus even in the absence of these chemical signals. The overactive protein may contribute to the development of LCH by allowing the Langerhans cells to grow and divide uncontrollably.[13803]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe protein produced by the <em>BRAF</em> gene is part of a signaling pathway known as the RAS/MAPK pathway, which controls several important cell functions. Specifically, the RAS/MAPK pathway regulates the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (migration), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). Chemical signaling through this pathway is essential for normal development before birth.[13802][13803]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <em>BRAF</em> gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. Changes in other genes such as the <em><a href=\"https://www.omim.org/entry/601263\" target=\"_blank\">MAP2K</a></em> gene (20% of the cases), and other rarer genes (also involved in the RAS/MAPK pathway), have also been identified in the Langerhans cells of some people with LCH. Some researchers believe that additional factors, such as viral infections and environmental toxins, may also influence the development of this complex disorder.[13803]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFamily members of LCH patients have a higher incidence of thyroid disease.

Somatic gene mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime, which means they are acquired after conception and are only present in certain cells. Because they are not present in the germ cells (egg and sperm), they are not passed on to the next generation (are not inherited).[13803]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <em>BRAF</em> gene provides instructions for making a protein that is normally switched on and off in response to signals that control cell growth and development. Somatic mutations cause the BRAF protein in affected cells to be continuously on and to transmit messages to the nucleus even in the absence of these chemical signals. The overactive protein may contribute to the development of LCH by allowing the Langerhans cells to grow and divide uncontrollably.[13803]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe protein produced by the <em>BRAF</em> gene is part of a signaling pathway known as the RAS/MAPK pathway, which controls several important cell functions. Specifically, the RAS/MAPK pathway regulates the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific functions (differentiation), cell movement (migration), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis). Chemical signaling through this pathway is essential for normal development before birth.[13802][13803]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe <em>BRAF</em> gene belongs to a class of genes known as oncogenes. When mutated, oncogenes have the potential to cause normal cells to become cancerous. Changes in other genes such as the <em><a href=\"https://www.omim.org/entry/601263\" target=\"_blank\">MAP2K</a></em> gene (20% of the cases), and other rarer genes (also involved in the RAS/MAPK pathway), have also been identified in the Langerhans cells of some people with LCH. Some researchers believe that additional factors, such as viral infections and environmental toxins, may also influence the development of this complex disorder.[13803]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFamily members of LCH patients have a higher incidence of thyroid disease.

The disease can affect virtually every organ, including skin, bones, lymph nodes, bone marrow, liver, spleen, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, thymus, central nervous system, and hormone glands. The symptoms may range from localized bone lesions or skin disease to multiple organ involvement and severe dysfunction.[1155]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBelow are the organs that may be affected as well as the symptoms that might be observed:[1155]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Skin - </strong>Red, scaly papules in areas where opposing skin surfaces touch or rub (e.g. skin folds) are commonly seen in LCH. Infants with the skin presentation on the scalp are often misdiagnosed with cradle cap. The skin symptoms usually improve without treatment.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li><strong>Bone</strong> - Lesions that cause bone destruction are common, with the skull, lower limbs, ribs, pelvis, and vertebrae usually being affected. Symptoms may include pain, swelling, limited motion, and inability to bear weight.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li><strong>Lymph node </strong>- Lymph node involvement may be limited or associated with a skin or bone lesion or disseminated disease. Although any of the lymph nodes may be affected, the cervical lymph nodes are where the disease commonly occurs. Individuals usually only present with pain of the lymph node affected. If only one lymph node is affected, prognosis is normally good and treatment is unnecessary.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li><strong>Liver</strong> - Liver involvement at the time of diagnosis is generally associated with more severe disease. Symptoms may include ascites, jaundice, low levels of protein, and prolonged clotting time.\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li><strong>Central nervous system (CNS) and hormone </strong>- CNS involvement is rare and may be devastating. The most common result of CNS involvement is the altering of hormonal function, with some individuals developing diabetes insipidus. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.histio.org/page.aspx?pid=380\" target=\"_blank\">More detailed information about the symptoms of&nbsp;LCH can be accessed through the Histiocytosis Association's website</a>.</p>\r\nIn adults with LCH, the lung is the most frequently involved organ system, and solitary lung lesions may be the only symptom.

In some cases, the disease will go away without any treatment at all. In other cases, depending on the extent of the disease, limited surgery and small doses of <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/Templates/db_alpha.aspx?CdrID=44971\" target=\"_blank\">radiation therapy</a> or <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/Templates/db_alpha.aspx?searchTxt=chemotherapy&amp;sgroup=Starts+with&amp;lang=\" target=\"_blank\">chemotherapy</a>&nbsp;may be needed. Treatment is planned after complete evaluation of the patient, with the goal of using as little treatment as possible to keep the disease under control.[536]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo consensus exists for the best therapy for LCH, especially when multiple organs are involved. However, the Histiocyte Society has done many clinical trials to evaluate the effect of several treatments, which have resulted in <a href=\"https://histiocytesociety.org/pages/2011-hs---lch-iv\" target=\"_blank\">recommendations by the Histiocyte Society</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGenerally, the choice of treatment is based on disease severity. The International LCH Study of the Histiocyte Society proposes classifying LCH cases by the number of systems involved and by the number of sites within that system (e.g., involving one or more bones, involving one or multiple lymph nodes). Although most of the trials are in children, the recommendations can also be used for adults.[13484]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1100579-treatment\" target=\"_blank\">Detailed information about the treatment of LCH can be viewed on Medscape Reference's Web site</a>.","dateModified":"2017-09-11T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":536,"authors":"","articleTitle":"LCH in Children","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Histiocytosis Association of America","date":"","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.histio.org/page.aspx?pid=379","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13484,"authors":"Shea CR","articleTitle":"Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"March 7, 2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1100579-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}]}],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
