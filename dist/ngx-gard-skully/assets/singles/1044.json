The skin lesions are due to abnormalities in different types of connective tissue. The bone spots are painless areas of increased bone density seen on X-ray. People with BOS may have only skin, only bone or both skin and bone involvement. Rarely, BOS causes <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/melorheostosis/\" target=\"_blank\">melorheostosis</a>, which results in abnormal bone growth and can lead to bone pain and abnormally flexed joints. Symptoms of BOS usually start in childhood. The skin lesions can increase with age, but they do not cause other symptoms. BOS is caused by variations&nbsp;in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LEMD3\" target=\"_blank\"><em>LEMD3</em></a>\r\ngene and is inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>&nbsp;pattern. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination, imaging studies, and may be confirmed by the results of genetic testing. Treatment of BOS is focused on managing the symptoms. Many people with BOS have no symptoms or pain and do not require any treatment.[15831][15832][15834]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2020-10-01T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":4203,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome (BOS).
