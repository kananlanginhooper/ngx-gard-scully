The onset of symptoms commonly occurs between 20 and 40 years of age and the disease seems to be relatively mild and benign. Symptoms may include mild loss of sensation in the fingertips and severe loss of sensation in the feet and legs. The most common type of sensation loss is to vibration, but proprioception (the sense of how we are oriented in space) and perception to pain may also be affected. Individuals with CMT2P may also have muscle twitches (fasciculations) and cramps (in younger patients) and muscular weakness and muscular wasting in the legs, feet and hands (in older individuals).

In routine needle-electrode examination (electromyography (EMG) of voluntary muscle contraction, the consultant assesses the&nbsp;electrical signal generated by the MUs, termed the \"MU action potential\" (or MUAP).
