IPF is now the most common indication for lung transplantation in the United States.&nbsp;Any person diagnosed with IPF should be referred for lung transplantation evaluation.[7569]&nbsp;A 2009 retrospective review of UNOS data found that the reported 5-year survival rates after lung transplantation in IPF were estimated at 50-56%.[7569] This is greater than the 20-30% general 5-year survival rate for affected people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is somewhat controversial whether people with IPF should have a single or bilateral lung transplant. Some have reported no difference in overall survival between the two types of transplants. Others have found a trend toward better early survival after a single transplant, and better long term survival after a bilateral transplant. It has now been seen in several studies that bilateral transplants may have better long-term outcomes, but worse short-term outcomes; single transplants have been associated with a slightly higher later risk of death.[7570]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough the question of whether to perform a single or bilateral transplant remains unanswered, there is an increasing tendency in the transplant community to perform bilateral rather than single lung transplants. The data overall seem to suggest that although bilateral lung transplant&nbsp;may increase the risk for early death, it promotes long-term survival. It is possible that the early mortality caused by bilateral lung transplants has been improved by better surgical techniques and critical care.[7570]","dateModified":"2014-07-31T09:33:00","references":[{"referenceId":7569,"authors":"Amanda M K Godfrey","articleTitle":"Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Treatment & Management","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"May 30, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/301226-treatment#a1128","dateAccessed":"2014-07-31T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":7570,"authors":"George TJ1, Arnaoutakis GJ, Shah AS","articleTitle":"Lung transplant in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Arch Surg","date":"October, 2011","volume":"146(10)","pages":"1204-1209","url":"","dateAccessed":"2014-07-31T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}]},{"caseId":22816,"abbreviatedInquiry":"My wife was recently diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
