All three of these genes give the body instructions to make parts of ion channels that are primarily expressed in skeletal muscle cells.[12306] Muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of ions into muscle cells. Mutations that cause HOKPP affect the usual structure or function of ion channels, impairing their ability to regulate the flow of ions into muscle cells. This, in turn, reduces the ability of skeletal muscles to contract, causing the weakness and paralysis associated with HOKPP.[1649]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot all people with a clinical diagnosis of HOKPP are found to have a mutation in one of the genes mentioned above.

However, inheritance from a parent may sometimes be \"masked\" by a parent not having symptoms.

About 10% of males with a mutation do not develop symptoms, and a higher percentage of females do not develop symptoms. The penetrance of HOKPP appears to depend on the specific gene and mutation responsible for the condition, and the gender of the person with the mutation. For example, one reported mutation in the <em>CACNA1S</em> gene appears to be fully penetrant in males (100% develop symptoms) but non-penetrant in females (none develop symptoms).
