These are more common on the knees, elbows, buttocks and shoulder blades. The slow onset of symptoms usually begins during adulthood, but children can also be affected. Other symptoms may&nbsp;include fluid-filled sores; red lesions that resemble hives; and itchiness, redness&nbsp;and burning. The exact cause of this disease is not known,&nbsp;but it is frequently associated with the inability to digest gluten.

When this medication is used to relieve the symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis, it should be taken in the smallest effective dose and for the shortest period possible.[7821] In some cases, immunosuppressive medications may be used.
