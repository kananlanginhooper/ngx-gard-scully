The <em>LMNA</em> gene provides instructions to the body to make a protein that is responsible for providing stability and strength to the cells. Specifically, <em>LMNA</em> provides instructions to make a protein that is located in the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2829960/\">nuclear envelope</a>, which surrounds the nucleus. The proteins of the nuclear envelope help move molecules in and out of the nucleus. When there are changes to the <em>LMNA</em> gene, this protein is not made correctly.

This could happen for a couple of reasons. First, it could be that there are other family members with the disease, but they do not know it because they have never been diagnosed. The symptoms of LGMD1B exhibit <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/inheritance/penetranceexpressivity\">variable expressivity</a>. This means that people with the disease can have many different signs and symptoms, even within the same family. For example, some people with LGMD1B may have heart problems but no other signs of muscle weakness.[14180] Therefore, it can sometimes be difficult to see a history of LGMD1B in the family of an affected individual. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, the reason that there is no family history of LGMD1B is because the affected individual is the first person in the family to have a genetic change in <em>LMNA</em>.[1118] In these cases, the genetic change is <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\">de novo</a>. </em>This means the genetic change&nbsp;happened for the first time in the family in the person who has symptoms of the disease, and other family members do not have LGMD1B.
