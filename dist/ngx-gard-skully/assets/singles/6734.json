The most severe forms of the disorder tend to occur before birth and in early infancy. Hypophosphatasia weakens and softens the bones, causing skeletal abnormalities similar to another childhood bone disorder called <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000344.htm\" target=_blank>rickets</a>. Affected infants are born with short limbs, an abnormally shaped chest, and soft skull bones.

These complications are life-threatening in some cases.[201]</p>\r\n<p>The forms of hypophosphatasia that appear in childhood or adulthood are typically less severe than those that appear in infancy. Early loss of primary (baby) teeth is one of the first signs of the condition in children. Affected children may have short stature with bowed legs or knock knees, enlarged wrist and ankle joints, and an abnormal skull shape. Adult forms of hypophosphatasia are characterized by a softening of the bones known as <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000376.htm\" target=_blank>osteomalacia</a>.

The most severe forms of the disorder tend to occur before birth and in early infancy. Hypophosphatasia weakens and softens the bones, causing skeletal abnormalities similar to another childhood bone disorder called <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000344.htm\" target=_blank>rickets</a>. Affected infants are born with short limbs, an abnormally shaped chest, and soft skull bones. Additional complications in infancy include poor feeding and a failure to gain weight, respiratory problems, and high levels of calcium in the blood (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000365.htm\" target=_blank>hypercalcemia</a>), which can lead to recurrent vomiting and kidney problems. These complications are life-threatening in some cases.[201]</p>\r\n<p>The forms of hypophosphatasia that appear in childhood or adulthood are typically less severe than those that appear in infancy. Early loss of primary (baby) teeth is one of the first signs of the condition in children. Affected children may have short stature with bowed legs or knock knees, enlarged wrist and ankle joints, and an abnormal skull shape. Adult forms of hypophosphatasia are characterized by a softening of the bones known as <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000376.htm\" target=_blank>osteomalacia</a>. In adults, recurrent fractures in the foot and thigh bones can lead to chronic pain. Affected adults may lose their secondary (adult) teeth prematurely and are at increased risk for joint pain and inflammation.[201]</p>\r\n<p>The mildest form of this condition, called <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=hypophosphatasia\" target=_blank>odontohypophosphatasia</a>, only affects the teeth. People with this disorder typically experience abnormal tooth development and premature tooth loss, but do not have the skeletal abnormalities seen in other forms of hypophosphatasia.[201]</p>","dateModified":"2013-07-17T15:54:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":201,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Hypophosphatasia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"September 2007","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=hypophosphatasia","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":271,"questionText":"How might hypophosphatasia be treated?","answerText":"Until recently, management of hypophosphatasia (HPP) has mostly been aimed at addressing symptoms of the condition.[10513] For example:<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Hydration, restriction of dietary calcium, vitamin D, and sometimes thiazide diuretics for hypercalcemia</li>\r\n    <li>Ventilatory support for severely affected infants, some of which need a tracheostomy, which can lead to problems with speech and language development and tolerance of oral feeds</li>\r\n    <li>Physiotherapy, occupational therapy and chronic pain management for pain and motor difficulty</li>\r\n    <li>Surgery for fractures that fail to heal</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMore recently, research has shown positive effects of human recombinant enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), called asfotase alfa, on people who began having symptoms before 6 months of age.
