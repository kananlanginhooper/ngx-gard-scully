This can cause a build-up of toxic substances which can lead to bouts of serious illness known as metabolic crises. There are two types of IVA. The acute, neonatal type has more severe symptoms that begin in the newborn period. In the chronic, intermittent type; symptoms appear during childhood and can come and go. Symptoms include poor feeding, tremor, vomiting, low muscle tone, and lack of energy (lethargy). These may get worse over time and lead to coma, and possibly death. One characteristic sign of IVA is an odor of sweaty feet during illness. IVA occurs due to variants in the <span class=\"geneSymbol\"><a href=\"http://www.ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/IVD\" target=\"_blank\"><em>IVD</em></a></span><em> </em>gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> pattern. Diagnosis of IVD is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and blood and urine testing. The results of genetic testing may help confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms and involves a special protein-restricted diet and medications that rid the body of excess isovaleric acid.[15883][15884][15885][15886]","dateModified":"2020-11-06T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":4464,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of isovaleric acidemia?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with isovaleric acidemia (IVA).
