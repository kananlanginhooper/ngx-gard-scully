They grow in the roots of the nerves that grow out of the spinal cord. Most of the time, Tarlov cysts don't cause symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include pain in the lower back, buttocks, or stomach. Other symptoms may include muscle weakness, numbness, loss of bladder or bowel control, or sexual dysfunction. Without treatment, Tarlov cysts may cause permanent nerve damage. The cause of Tarlov cysts is unknown. They may occur because of a buildup of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) that occurs after trauma, surgery, or a small abnormality in spine development. Diagnosis of a Tarlov cyst is made based on the symptoms and through imaging studies such as an MRI and/or <a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/neurological/myelogram_92,P07670\" target=\"_blank\">CT myelogram</a>. Treatment depends on the symptoms and size of the cyst(s).
