However, this possible association needs further study.

Because of these findings, increased vigilance with respect to sun protection, investigation of skin lesions in balanced translocation carriers, and close attention to possible cancer symptoms as per the general population have been suggested.[8433]","dateModified":"2016-06-28T00:00:00","references":[{"referenceId":8433,"authors":"Emanuel BS,  Zackai EH & Medne L","articleTitle":"Emanuel Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"August 31, 2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1263/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}]},{"caseId":27223,"abbreviatedInquiry":"I have a chance to work with a child who has Emanuel sydrome.&nbsp;What is a child with this capable of learning?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is&nbsp;there&nbsp;a Web page that summarizes this syndrome&nbsp;and would be helpful to&nbsp;me?","caseQuestions":[{"questionId":3516,"questionText":"Is&nbsp;there&nbsp;a Web page that summarizes this syndrome&nbsp;and would be helpful to&nbsp;me?","answerText":"The following Web pages provide further details regarding Emanuel syndrome and may be helpful resources.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.rarechromo.org/information/Chromosome%2011/Emanuel%20syndrome%20FTNW.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Unique Rare Chromosome Disorder Support Group</a>&nbsp;offers a detailed article on Emanuel syndrome. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/emanuel-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Genetics Home Reference (GHR)</a>&nbsp;contains a condition summary on Emanuel syndrome. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=gene&amp;part=emanuel\" target=\"_blank\">GeneReviews</a>&nbsp;provides current, expert-authored, peer-reviewed, full-text articles describing the application of genetic testing to the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling of patients with specific inherited conditions.<br />","dateModified":"2016-06-28T00:00:00","references":[]},{"questionId":3515,"questionText":"What is a child with&nbsp;Emanuel syndrome&nbsp;capable of learning?","answerText":"Children with Emanuel syndrome usually have severe to profound intellectual disability, however severity of intellectual disability varies from case to case. Intellectual disability is a term used when a person has certain limitations in mental functioning and in skills such as communicating, taking care of him or herself, and social skills. These limitations will cause a child to learn and develop more slowly than a typical child. There may be some things they cannot learn.[2456]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo diagnose an intellectual disability, professionals look at the person's mental abilities (IQ) and his or her adaptive skills. Both of these are highlighted in the definition provided in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The IDEA is the federal law that guides how schools provide early intervention and special education and related services to children with disabilities.[2456] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen children become school aged learning goals are individually set.&nbsp;School staff work with the child's parents to develop an Individualized Education Program and a Individualized Family Services Plan, which describes the child's unique needs and the services that have been designed to meet those needs.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe&nbsp;National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities provides&nbsp;further information on this&nbsp;topic at the following link: <a href=\"mailto:http://www.parentcenterhub.org/repository/iep-specialeducation/\">Special Education</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe following organizations can provide you with further information as you&nbsp;seek to&nbsp;assist the child's family&nbsp;in setting and achieving his or her developmental and learning goals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNational Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities<br />\r\nP.O.
