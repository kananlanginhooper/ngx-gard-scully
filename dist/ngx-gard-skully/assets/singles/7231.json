Ochronosis associated with alkaptonuria is caused by a mutation in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HGD\" target=\"_blank\">HGD</a></em> gene, which results in the accumulation and deposition of <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/homogentisic%20acid\" target=\"_blank\">homogentisic acid</a> (HGA) in <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/cartilagedisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">cartilage</a>.[15397] The affected tissue becomes weak and brittle with time, leading to chronic inflammation, joint pain, and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/osteoarthritis.html\" target=\"_blank\">osteoarthritis</a>. Alkaptonuria is inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> manner. Alkaptonuria can be diagnosed based on the symptoms, laboratory testing, and genetic testing. There is no specific treatment for ochronosis associated with alkaptonuria and treatment is based on the symptoms.[15397]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen ochronosis is due to exposure to substances (called <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/10757/Exogenous_ochronosis.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">exogenous ochronosis</a>), the condition is not inherited.[15396][15398] Exogenous ochronosis is associated with malarial drugs, skin-lightening creams and over-exposure to the sun. Other than the skin findings, there are no other health affects. Exogenous ochronosis is difficult to diagnose.&nbsp; There is no specific treatment for this condition. Several different treatment options are available including prescription skin creams, vitamins, and laser treatments.[15396]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2019-04-29T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":15396,"authors":"Vashi N.
