There are several types of adenylosuccinase deficiency. Symptoms vary greatly from person to person. In general, adenylosuccinase deficiency causes intellectual and movement disabilities,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/autism.html\" target=\"_blank\">autistic features</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/epilepsy.html\" target=\"_blank\">epilepsy</a>, low muscle tone, and feeding problems. In the most severe form of this condition, symptoms begin in infancy and death usually occurs in early childhood. Adenylosuccinase deficiency occurs due to a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ADSL\" target=\"_blank\"><em>ADSL</em></a> gene that is not working correctly and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/illustrations/autorecessive\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> fashion.
