In some cases, BPOP does not cause symptoms. However, at other times, it can be painful and lead to bone deformity.[13875][13876]&nbsp; It is more commonly located on the hands and feet, but can also affect the long bones or bones of the skull and face. A biopsy of the affected bone is important, as BPOP may resemble malignant bone tumors, especially&nbsp;<a href=\"http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00395\" target=\"_blank\">chondrosarcoma</a>&nbsp;or parosteal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/osteosarcoma/about/what-is-osteosarcoma.html\" target=\"_blank\">osteosarcoma</a>.[13877] The cause is still unknown though injuries or bone defects may trigger the condition in some cases. Treatment involves surgery to remove the tumor. There is a 20%-50% chance that the condition may reappear after surgery.[13876][13877]<br />","dateModified":"2017-10-02T15:06:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
