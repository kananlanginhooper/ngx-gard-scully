These glands&nbsp;are located right above the kidneys. Pheochromocytomas cause the adrenal glands to make too many stress hormones called epinephrines and norepinephrines. This can lead to <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/highbloodpressure.html\" target=\"_blank\">high blood pressure</a>&nbsp;and cause symptoms such as severe headaches, irritability, sweating, rapid heart rate, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, weakness, chest pain, and  anxiety. Rarely, this kind of tumor occurs outside the adrenal gland, usually somewhere in the abdomen. These are called extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas. The cause of most pheochromocytomas is unknown. In some cases, there is a genetic cause.
