The patients usually seek medical attention because of the pain.  The syndrome may be unilateral or bilateral. Identical toe movements may occur without pain, referred to as: \"painless legs-moving toes,\" and a similar condition affects the upper limbs: \"painful arms-moving fingers.\" The cause of PLMT and its variants is not known but most reports suggest an association with a <a href=\"https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/nsdivide.html\" target=\"_blank\">peripheral lesion</a>, usually at the level of the root or nerve, though in many cases no cause is found. Treatment is often unsatisfactory and may include medication for neuropathic pain (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a694007.html\" target=\"_blank\">gabapentin</a>), <a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/teen/your_body/medical_care/anesthesia_basics.html\" target=\"_blank\">spinal blocks</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007560.htm\" target=\"_blank\">spinal cord stimulation</a>, and local injection of <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/botox.html\" target=\"_blank\">botulinum toxin</a>. It is a debilitating clinical syndrome, not because of the movements but rather because of the pain.[9387][9388]","dateModified":"2015-07-25T13:17:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":9385,"authors":"Reich SG","articleTitle":"Painful legs and moving toes","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Handb Clin Neurol","date":"2011","volume":"100","pages":"375-83","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21496596","dateAccessed":"2015-07-25T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9386,"authors":"Hassan A, Mateen FJ, Coon EA, & Ahlskog JE","articleTitle":"Painful legs and moving toes syndrome: a 76-patient case series","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Arch Neurol","date":"August 2012","volume":"69(8)","pages":"1032-8","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22490324","dateAccessed":"2015-07-25T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
