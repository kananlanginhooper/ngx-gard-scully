Symptoms may include eyelid drooping (ptosis), swallowing difficulty, hoarse and nasal voice, leg and arm weakness, as well as muscle wasting in the face and in the legs and arms. Many people have respiratory problems due to respiratory muscle weakness. In rare cases, there is also hearing loss, as well as severe weakness in muscles of the forearms and thighs. As the disease progresses, other muscles may be affected.[14023][14025][14024] A blood exam may show an increased creatine kinase level and an abnormal EMG. Inheritance may be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. The specific cause is still unknown.[14023][14024]","dateModified":"2017-11-01T00:22:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":7922,"relatedDiseaseName":"Muscular dystrophy","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12583,"relatedDiseaseName":"Progressive muscular dystrophy","relation":"Parent","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":false}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
