Intestinal hypoganglionosis can mimic <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/6660/hirschsprungs-disease/your-questions-answered\" target=\"_blank\">Hirschsprung disease</a>; patients with both conditions may present with chronic constipation, intestinal obstruction, and enterocolitis (inflammation of the intestines).[9473][9474] Patients with hypoganglionosis may also suffer from severe complications including fecaloma (hardening of the feces inside the colon), bleeding or perforation of the intestine, and breathing problems resulting from a distended colon.[9473] An accurate diagnosis in adults is often difficult, requiring one or more biopsies of the intestinal wall.[9473][9475] The exact cause of hypoganglionoisis is not known. In some cases, it is due to factors present at birth (congenital), while other times it is believed to be an acquired condition. The management of isolated hypoganglionosis generally involves surgery to remove the affected bowel segment.[9474]","dateModified":"2015-08-07T17:05:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
