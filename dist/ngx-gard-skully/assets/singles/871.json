Low levels of hemoglobin lead to a shortage of mature red blood cells and a lack of oxygen in the body. People with beta-thalassemia have <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000560.htm\" target=\"_blank\">anemia</a>, which can cause paleness, weakness, fatigue, and more serious complications.[1535] There are two main forms of beta-thalassemia, classified based on the severity of symptoms:[9406]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Thalassemia major</strong> (also called Cooley's anemia) - the more severe form, causing severe anemia and enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). This form usually becomes apparent before 2 years of age. If not treated, it causes failure to thrive and a shortened life expectancy. Treatment involves regular transfusions and <a href=\"http://www.irondisorders.org/chelation-therapy\" target=\"_blank\">chelation therapy</a> to reduce iron overload. Treatment allows for normal growth and development. Bone marrow transplantation or cord blood transplantation may eliminate the need for regular treatment.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Thalassemia intermedia</strong> - the less severe form, becoming apparent later and causing milder anemia that does not require regular blood transfusions. People with this form are also at risk for iron overload.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBeta-thalassemia is caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in the <a title=\"H B B\" href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene=hbb\" target=\"_blank\"><em>HBB</em></a> gene and is typically inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> manner.
