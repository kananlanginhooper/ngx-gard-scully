In many cases more than one member of the same family is affected with PAS III, suggesting that its inheritance could be autosomal dominant, and therefore, familiar screening is recommended. It is very important that people with APS3 are monitored closely by their doctors  for early detection of any glandular problems. Treatment includes lifelong hormone replacement therapy for any established glandular failure.[5761]","dateModified":"2018-04-05T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
