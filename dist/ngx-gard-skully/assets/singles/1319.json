It most often occurs on the limbs, but can affect any area of the body. Chromoblastomycosis is caused by several fungi found in soil, wood, and decaying plant material. It usually enters the skin through a minor injury such as a splinter.[8008] It is most common in areas with tropical and subtropical climates.[8009] Treatment of chromoblastomycosis may include medications like <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a692049.html\" target=\"_blank\">itraconazole</a> and <a href=\"http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/lexicomp/flucytosine.html\" target=\"_blank\">flucytosine</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007506.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cryotherapy</a>, or surgery.[8008][8009]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2014-12-16T17:35:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":8008,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Chromoblastomycosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"DermNet NZ","date":"December 29, 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.dermnetnz.org/fungal/chromoblastomycosis.html","dateAccessed":"2014-12-16T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
