The condition is characterized by three main symptoms: brain disease (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/encephalitis.html\">encephalopathy</a>), hearing loss, and vision loss. Some people may not have all signs of Susac syndrome, but instead develop only specific combinations of the symptoms. Susac syndrome affects women more than men. The age at which symptoms begin is usually between 20 and 40 years, but some people have symptoms earlier or later than this age range.[252] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cause of Susac syndrome is still unknown. Diagnosis is based on a clinical exam and imaging tests to look for the specific signs of Susac syndrome.[253] Treatment options include <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/corticosteroids-oral/article.htm\">corticosteroids</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682080.html\">cyclophosphamide</a> as well as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bloodthinners.html\">anticoagulation medications</a>.

The three main parts of the body that are affected are the brain, eyes, and ears. However, all three body parts are not affected in all people with Susac syndrome.[252] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA headache is often one of the earliest symptoms of Susac syndrome. Recurrent headaches may be a sign of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/encephalitis.html\">encephalopathy</a>, or brain disease. Other neurological symptoms may develop including walking difficulties (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003198.htm\">ataxia</a>), slurred speech (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007470.htm\">dysarthria</a>), and cognitive changes including memory loss, confusion, and personality or behavioral changes.[580] In some cases, affected individuals may have urinary dysfunction or muscle pain (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003178.htm\">myalgia</a>).[7537] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAffected people may also have specific findings in the eyes called <a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1223362-overview\">branch retinal artery occlusions</a> (BRAO). This occurs when one of the blood vessels that supply blood to the retina (retinal arteries) become blocked. This can cause dark spots in the vision, but some people have no symptoms of BRAO.[252]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSusac syndrome can also cause hearing loss due to poor circulation to the ears. Ringing in the ears (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/tinnitus.html\">tinnitus</a>) may also be present. The ears also have a role in regulating our balance. Therefore, some people with Susac syndrome experience<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/dizzinessandvertigo.html\"> vertigo</a> and feel like their surroundings are spinning.[252]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople with Susac syndrome may find that their symptoms go away and return again over a period of years. Other people experience symptoms only once, and after treatment the symptoms go away completely. Although the condition may resolve on its own, some people can develop long-term neurological damage, vision loss, or hearing loss.[778]","dateModified":"2017-02-25T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":252,"authors":"Rennebohm R, Egan RA, and Susac JO [now deceased]","articleTitle":"Susac's Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)","date":"2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/susacs-syndrome/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":580,"authors":"Do TH, Fisch C, Evoy F","articleTitle":"Susac Syndrome: Report of Four Cases and Review of the Literature","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Am J Neuroradiol","date":"March, 2004","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/content/full/25/3/382","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":778,"authors":"Aubart-Cohen, et.al.","articleTitle":"Long-Term Outcome in Susac Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medicine","date":"March 2007"},{"referenceId":7537,"authors":"Jan-Markus Dorr","articleTitle":"Susac syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet","date":"September, 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=EN&Expert=838","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":964,"questionText":"What causes Susac syndrome?","answerText":"The exact cause of Susac syndrome currently is not known.

When this occurs, it can cause swelling of the small blood vessels that supply blood to the brain, retina, and inner ear. This swelling can cause the blood vessels to completely close up so that parts of the body are not getting enough blood or oxygen.
