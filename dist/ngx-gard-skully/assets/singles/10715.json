Symptoms of this condition may include decreased muscle tone (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003298.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypotonia</a>), slow growth, characteristic facial features, fusion or webbing&nbsp;between the fingers and/or toes (syndactyly), and unusual skin pigmentation. Intellectual disabilities may be present. DSM occurs when a person has some cells with three copies of each chromosome for a total of 69 chromosomes (triploid cells) and some cells with the usual 2 copies of each chromosome for a total of 46 chromosomes (diploid cells). Having two or more different cell types is called mosaicism. Diagnosis is made through a clinical exam and a <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003840.htm\" target=\"_blank\">skin biopsy</a>.
