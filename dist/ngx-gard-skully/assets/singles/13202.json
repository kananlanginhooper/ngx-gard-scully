Early symptoms include poor muscle tone, poor feeding, seizures, and a gradual loss of skills. HIBCH deficiency can cause signs and symptoms similar to another disease, called <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6877/leigh-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Leigh syndrome</a>.[13074] Diagnosis is aided by blood tests which show high levels of lactic acid, and imaging studies which show changes in the \"globi pallidi\" structure of the brain.[13073][13074] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHIBCH deficiency occurs when a person inherits a mutation in both copies of their <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HIBCH\" target=\"_blank\">HIBCH</a>&nbsp;</em>gene. This pattern of inheritance is called \"autosomal recessive.\"[13073] The HIBCH gene tells the body how to make an enzyme called 3-hyroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase. When the body does not have enough working enzyme, it can not break down the amino acid <a href=\"http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biochemistry/problem_sets/aa/Valine.html\" target=\"_blank\">valine.</a> As a result, toxic valine metabolites build up in the body.

This leads to a build up of toxic valine metabolites within the&nbsp;mitochondria in the body's cells.[2] Valine is an essential amino acid, which means that it cannot be made by the body, but instead must be obtained from diet.[3] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nValine catabolism involves several steps with different enzymes acting in each step. The 3-hydroxy-isobutyryl-CoA hydrolase (HIBCH) is a mitochondrial enzyme that acts in the 5<sup>th</sup> step, therefore all the substances that are produced before this step build-up. <span>One of the metabolites, known as methacrylyl-CoA, can react with other mitochondrial enzymes and disrupt their activities.&nbsp; As a result,<strong> </strong>patients with</span><span> </span><span>HIBCH deficiency have features similar to Leigh disease and other mitochondrial disorders.[13073][13074][13079]</span><br />\r\n<span><br />\r\nHIBCH deficiency is considered an organic acidemia.&nbsp;Organic acidemias are so named because they disrupt amino acid\r\nmetabolism. This causes an increase in organic acid levels. In  HIBCH deficiency we see an increase in lactic acid. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHIBCH deficiency can also be considered a mitochondrial disease, because it  disrupts mitochondrial enzymes. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe involvement of the&nbsp;globi pallidi  in HIBCH deficiency is one of the main features of the disease. The&nbsp;globi pallidi is part of the basal ganglia in the brain. The reason that the globi pallidi is affected may be due to a failure in providing energy to the brain which results in the early death of brain cells.

Propionate is a substance produced by the break down of some aminoacids. However, the HIBCH gene mutations do not appear to result in adverse symptoms related to this pathway.[13073]","dateModified":"2017-02-17T12:10:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":13071,"authors":"Ravenscroft G & cols","articleTitle":"Recurrent de novo BICD2 mutation associated with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Neuromuscul Disord","date":"November, 2016","volume":"26(11)","pages":"744-748","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27751653","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13073,"authors":"Petersc H & Ferdinanddussed S, Ruiterd JP & Wandersd RJA","articleTitle":"Metabolite studies in HIBCH and ECHS1 defects: Implications for screening","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Molecular Genetics and Metabolism","date":"August, 2015","volume":"115 (4)","pages":"168–173","url":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096719215300275","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13074,"authors":"Reuter MS & cols","articleTitle":"HIBCH deficiency in a patient with phenotypic characteristics of mitochondrial disorders","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Am J Med Genet A","date":"2014","volume":"164A(12)","pages":"3162-9","url":"http://www.medscape.com/medline/abstract/25251209","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":13079,"authors":"Brown G K & cols","articleTitle":"Beta-hydroxyisobutyryl coenzyme A deacylase deficiency: a defect in valine metabolism associated with physical malformations","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Pediatrics","date":"1982","volume":"70","pages":"532-538","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7122152","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":11639,"questionText":"How might HIBCH deficiency be treated?","answerText":"Treatment of HIBCH deficiency involves frequent carbohydrate-rich meals, along with coenzyme Q10, vitamin C, and vitamin E supplementation.[13100] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople with HIBCH deficiency may also benefit from a low-valine diet with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nahfoundation.org/health/medical/altmed/supplement/carnitine-lcarnitine\">carnitine</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/cysteine\">N-acetyl-cysteine</a> supplementation.[13100] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrompt, supportive, treatment during periods of physical stress and viral illness is vital.
