Although the worms that cause schistosomiasis are not found in the United States, more than 200 million people are infected worldwide.[5901] Infection occurs through contact with&nbsp;contaminated water. The parasite in its infective stages is called a cercaria. It swims freely in open bodies of water. On contact with humans, the parasite burrows into the skin, matures into another stage (schistosomula), then migrates to the lungs and liver, where it matures into the adult form. The adult worm then migrates to its preferred body part (bladder, rectum, intestines, liver, portal venous system (the veins that carry blood from the intestines to liver, spleen, lungs), depending on its species.[5902]&nbsp; Schistosomiasis is common in many tropical and subtropical areas worldwide.&nbsp;It&nbsp;can be treated safely and effectively with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a608048.html\" target=_blank>praziquantel</a>.[5901][5902] ","dateModified":"2013-03-15T16:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6802,"questionText":"How is schistosomiasis diagnosed?","answerText":"Examination of stool and/or urine for ova is the primary method of diagnosis for schistosomiasis.

Blood tests are indicated for travelers or immigrants from endemic areas who have not been treated (or not treated appropriately) in the past. The most common tests detect antibodies to the adult worm. For accurate results, the blood sample tested should be collected at least 6 to 8 weeks after likely infection. Blood testing may not be appropriate for patients who have been repeatedly infected and treated in the past because antibodies can persist despite cure. In these patients, blood testing cannot distinguish between a past or current infection. A specific blood test has been developed for this population (which can detect an active infection based on the presence of&nbsp; schistosomal antigen), but this test is not commercially available in the United States and is currently being studied for its ability to detect mild infections.[5903]&nbsp;</p>","dateModified":"2013-03-15T16:03:00","resourceClassificationName":"Diagnosis","references":[{"referenceId":5903,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Parasites - Schistosomiasis: Resources for Health Professionals","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","date":"November 2012","url":"http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/schistosomiasis/health_professionals/index.html#dx","dateAccessed":"2013-03-15T00:00:00"}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[{"caseId":38540,"abbreviatedInquiry":"How is schistosomiasis diagnosed?
