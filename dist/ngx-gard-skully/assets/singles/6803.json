The exact cause of&nbsp;the condition&nbsp;is unknown. One theory is that the disorder occurs because of an extreme conditioned response to a particular situation influenced by cultural factors.&nbsp;It was first identified during the late nineteenth century in Maine and the Canadian province of Quebec&nbsp;in an&nbsp;isolated population of lumberjacks of French Canadian descent. Jumping Frenchmen of Maine is&nbsp;a type of&nbsp;startle-matching syndrome. These syndromes have been described&nbsp;in many different parts of the world.[2523]","dateModified":"2015-11-20T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
