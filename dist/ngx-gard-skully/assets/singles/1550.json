Affected people may also have heart abnormalities such as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.com/print/tachycardia/DS00929/DSECTION=all&amp;METHOD=print\" target=\"_blank\">tachycardia</a>, structural heart defects, and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000192.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</a>. Beginning in early childhood, people with Costello syndrome additionally have an increased risk to develop certain cancerous and noncancerous tumors.
