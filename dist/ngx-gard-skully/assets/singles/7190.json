A recent study found that the blood-brain barrier can be damaged by the protein aggregates that form in the brains of Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients. This allows toxins to enter the brain, further harming neurons. Researchers at MIT have found a drug, etodolac, that restores the blood-brain barrier and continue to search for effective drugs.","url":"http://news.mit.edu/2019/alzheimers-model-blood-brain-0812","lastModified":"2019-08-27T11:17:00","isFeatured":false},{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
