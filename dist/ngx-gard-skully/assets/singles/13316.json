Infants with this syndrome can have low muscle tone (hypotonia), feeding difficulties, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder. They also typically have joint contractures, affecting the finger joints and sometimes the knees and elbows. This syndrome does not usually cause the high appetite seen in people with Prader-Willi syndrome. Schaaf-Yang syndrome is caused by a mutation in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MAGEL2\" target=\"_blank\">MAGEL2</a> gene on <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/15\" target=\"_blank\">chromosome 15</a>. This syndrome is related to Prader-Willi syndrome because if MAGEL2 and several additional genes on chromosome 15 are missing or inactivated, then a person will develop Prader-Willi syndrome.[13639][13640]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2017-07-25T12:01:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":13640,"authors":"Fountain MD, Aten E, Cho MT, et al","articleTitle":"The phenotypic spectrum of Schaaf-Yang syndrome â€“ 18 new affected individuals from 14 families","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics in medicine?: official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics","date":"2017","volume":"19(1)","pages":"45-52","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5116288/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
