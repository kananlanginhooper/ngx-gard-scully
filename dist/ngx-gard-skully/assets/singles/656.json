Signs and symptoms depend on where the amyloid protein is building up.[3689] Amyloid build-up in the nerves of the peripheral nervous system causes a loss of sensation in the lower limbs, feet, and hands (peripheral neuropathy). Amyloid build-up can also affect the involuntary body functions, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and digestion.[3689][13979] Other areas of the body that may be affected are the heart, kidneys, eyes, and gastrointestinal tract.[3689]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFTA is caused by changes (mutations) in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TTR\" target=\"_blank\">TTR</a></em> gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, but not all people with a <em><a href=\"http:https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TTR\" target=\"_blank\">TTR</a></em> gene mutation will develop FTA.[13979][13980] Diagnosis of FTA is suspected by signs and symptoms and confirmed by tissue biopsy and genetic testing.[3689]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrimary treatment is a liver transplantation. This procedure removes the main source of amyloid from the body, but amyloid may still build-up in the heart, brain, and eyes. New medications have become available that block the formation of amyloid and may provide an alternative to liver transplant. Other treatments include heart and/or kidney transplantation, putting in a pacemaker, replacing the fluid in the eye (<a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/what-is-vitrectomy#1\" target=\"_blank\">vitrectomy</a>), and various medications.[13980] FTA is typically a fatal condition, but life expectancy depends on many factors.[3689][13980]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2018-11-15T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":5293,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of familial transthyretin amyloidosis?","answerText":"Familial transthyretin amyloidosis (FTA) is a slowly progressing, adult-onset condition.[3689][13890] Symptoms depend on which body parts are most affected.
