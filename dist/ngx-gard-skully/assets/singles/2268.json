Glycogen is created when the body needs to store glucose (sugar). When the body needs sugar again, glycogen is transformed back into glucose for use.[13118] People with Fanconi Bickel syndrome do not store the appropriate amount of glycogen. Therefore, Fanconi Bickel syndrome is known as a <a href=\"https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/health/g/gsd\">glycogen storage disease</a>. Specifically, glycogen accumulates in the liver and kidneys. Signs and symptoms begin in the first few months of life and include growing slower than expected (<a href=\"http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/pediatrics/failure_to_thrive_90,P02297/\">failure to thrive</a>), excessive urination (<a href=\"http://www.healthline.com/health/urination-excessive-volume\">polyuria</a>), and&nbsp; weakened bones (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000344.htm\">rickets</a>).
