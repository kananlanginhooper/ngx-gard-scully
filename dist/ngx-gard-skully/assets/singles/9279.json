There are two forms of this condition, a mild form and a severe form. People with the mild form have minor delays in physical and mental development and may have mild intellectual disability. They also have unusually high levels of a molecule called formiminoglutamate (FIGLU) in their urine. Individuals&nbsp;with the severe form have profound intellectual disability, delayed development of motor skills (sitting, standing, and walking) and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/1214.htm\" target=\"_blank\">megaloblastic anemia</a>. In addition to FIGLU in their urine, they have elevated amounts of certain B vitamins (called folates) in their blood. Glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency is caused by mutations in the <span class=\"geneSymbol\"><em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FTCD\" target=\"_blank\">FTCD</a></em></span> gene. It is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> pattern.
