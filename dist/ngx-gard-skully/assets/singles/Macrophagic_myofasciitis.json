More than 600 cases have been reported to date, most of them in France. This is probably due to large-scale vaccination with aluminium-containing vaccines in France during the 1990s. The disease generally manifests with myalgias of variable intensity, and is usually associated with weakness and chronic fatigue. Belongs to the group of Autoimmune/inflammatory Syndromes Induced by Adjuvants (ASIA): it is triggered, probably in genetically predisposed patients, by injection of vaccines containing aluminium hydroxide and may occur up to 10 years following vaccination.","Disease__c":"Macrophagic myofasciitis","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C2931639","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
