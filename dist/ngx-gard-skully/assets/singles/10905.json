People with dyskeratosis congenita also have an increased risk of developing several life-threatening conditions, including pulmonary fibrosis, bone marrow failure, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, leukemia, and other cancers. The severity of dyskeratosis congenita varies widely among affected individuals.[4896][13840]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis condition is caused by pathogenic variants (<a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>)&nbsp;in a number of different genes known to affect the length of the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/art/large/telomere.jpeg?ow\" target=\"_blank\">telomeres</a>.[13840] Teleomeres are structures found at the ends of chromosomes that protect the chromosomes from sticking together or breaking down. In most cells, the telomeres get shorter over time and eventually tell the cell to stop dividing.[4896] The genes known to be involved in dyskeratosis congenita include <a class=\"geneSymbol \" title=\"D K C 1\" href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DKC1\" target=\"_blank\"><span><em>DKC1</em></span></a>, <a class=\"geneSymbol \" title=\"T E R C\" href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TERC\" target=\"_blank\"><span><em>TERC</em></span></a>, <a class=\"geneSymbol \" title=\"T E R T\" href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TERT\" target=\"_blank\"><span><em>TERT</em></span></a>, <a class=\"geneSymbol \" title=\"T I N F 2\" href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TINF2\" target=\"_blank\"><span><em>TINF2</em></span></a>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ACD\" target=\"_blank\">ACD</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CTC1\" target=\"_blank\">CTC1</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/NHP2\" target=\"_blank\">NHP2</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/NOP10\" target=\"_blank\">NOP10</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PARN\" target=\"_blank\">PARN</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/RTEL1\" target=\"_blank\">RTEL1</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/WRAP53\" target=\"_blank\">WRAP53</a></em>. Approximately 70% of those who meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for dyskeratosis congenita have a mutation in one of these genes.[13840] How dyskeratosis congenita is inherited depends on which gene is involved.[4896][13840] Treatment is aimed at addressing the symptoms present in each individual.[13840]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2017-09-22T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":6299,"relatedDiseaseName":"Dyskeratosis congenita autosomal dominant","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":6300,"relatedDiseaseName":"Dyskeratosis congenita autosomal recessive","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":2007,"relatedDiseaseName":"Dyskeratosis congenita X-linked","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":6317,"relatedDiseaseName":"Ectodermal dysplasia","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":5107,"relatedDiseaseName":"T cell immunodeficiency primary","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
