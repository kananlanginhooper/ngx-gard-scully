The overgrowth is more apparent in infancy and may lessen with time. Other symptoms may include curved fingers, eyes that may not line up in the same direction (<a href=\"https://www.aapos.org/terms/conditions/100\" target=\"_blank\">strabismus</a>), and facial features such as full cheeks and an increase in the distance between the eyes. The syndrome is caused by changes (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>) in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HIST1H1E#normalfunction\" target=\"_blank\">HIST1H1E</a>&nbsp;</em>gene. The protein made from the <em>HISTH1E</em> gene helps control which genetic information is turned on (expressed) at any given time. Only one copy of the <em>HIST1H1E</em> gene needs to have a disease-causing genetic change to have Rahman syndrome, which is consistent with an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>&nbsp;condition. However, most of the reported cases of Rahman syndrome have not been inherited from the parents, but have been caused by a genetic change that happens by mistake during the making of the egg or sperm (de novo). Rahman syndrome may be suspected by symptoms, but the diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing. Rahman syndrome is one of a group of disorders that have been associated with overgrowth and intellectual disability.[14226][14227]","dateModified":"2018-01-08T09:22:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
