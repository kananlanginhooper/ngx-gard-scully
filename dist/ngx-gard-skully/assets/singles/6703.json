Some individuals never have symptoms of this condition. Symptoms usually do not appear unless a second genetic or environmental factor adds to increased lipid levels. Symptoms may include: yellowish lipid-filled bumps on the skin (xanthomas), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), and a buildup of fat in the blood vessels (atherosclerosis). Hyperlipidemia type 3 may lead to the development of <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000759.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cardiovascular disease</a>.[12845][12846] This condition is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/APOE\" target=\"_blank\">APOE</a></em> gene. The inheritance of this condition is considered to be complicated, as having mutations in the <em>APOE</em> gene often does not lead to the development of symptoms without the influence of other factors. Most people with symptoms of hyperlipidemia type 3 have two mutations in the <em>APOE</em> gene, inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[12846][12734] Treatment often includes management of diet, exercise, and use of lipid-lowering medications.[12734]","dateModified":"2016-12-29T14:29:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
