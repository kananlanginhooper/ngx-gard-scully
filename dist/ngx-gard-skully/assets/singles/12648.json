It is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Diagnosis is made through a clinical examination and confirmed by DNA testing.

In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), an alteration needs to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the condition. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nX-linked recessive conditions affect males much more frequently than females. Females, who have one altered gene, are called carriers. While most female carriers have no signs or symptoms of the condition, in rare cases, female carriers may experience some mild signs or symptoms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA female who carries one X-linked gene alteration has a 50% or 1 in 2 chance of having a son with the condition and a 50% chance of having a daughter who is also a carrier. A male with an X-linked recessive condition cannot pass on the disorder to his sons, but all of his daughters will be carriers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSometimes a male child is the first person in a family with the condition.
