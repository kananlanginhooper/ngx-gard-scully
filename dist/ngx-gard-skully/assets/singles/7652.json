Researchers believe that both environmental and genetic factors may play a role (multifactorial). Some cases are thought to result from irregularities in early development of the circulatory system, as some individuals with sirenomelia have a single large artery branching off of the aorta (instead of the usual two). Abnormalities in this blood delivery system decreases blood flow to the lower areas of the embryo, interfering with development.[3408] Some of the risk factors that have been identified in this condition include maternal diabetes, teratogens, genetic factors and maternal age younger than 20 years.[11025]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2016-03-24T17:37:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":3408,"authors":"Crawford SE","articleTitle":"Sirenomelia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"NORD","date":"2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/sirenomelia/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11025,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Sirenomelia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet","date":"July 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=en&Expert=3169","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
