However, baroreflex failure can result from surgery or radiation treatment for cancers of the neck, injury to the nerves involved in sensing blood pressure, or a degenerative neurologic disease.[9053][9054] Treatment usually involves medications to control blood pressure and heart rate along with stress reduction techniques.[9054]","dateModified":"2015-06-12T09:09:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
