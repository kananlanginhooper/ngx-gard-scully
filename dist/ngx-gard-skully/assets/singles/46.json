The cerebral cortex is responsible for most of the brain's&nbsp;processing of information, and the basal ganglia are deep brain structures that help start and control movement. Signs and symptoms of corticobasal degeneration&nbsp;include poor coordination, loss of movement, rigidity, poor balance, unnatural posturing of the muscles, intellectual (cognitive) impairment, speech impairment, muscular jerks, and difficulty swallowing. These symptoms develop and worsen&nbsp;over time. Currently the cause of corticobasal degeneration is not known.[2370] Treatment depends on the symptoms in each person. People with corticobasal degeneration usually do not survive beyond an average of 7 years after symptoms begin. Aspiration pneumonia or other complications are usually the cause of death.[13181]","dateModified":"2017-03-13T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":3413,"questionText":"What causes corticobasal degeneration?","answerText":"The underlying cause of corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is poorly understood.
