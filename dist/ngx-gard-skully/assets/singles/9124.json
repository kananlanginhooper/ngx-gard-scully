In a few cases, the genetic cause of the condition is unknown.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese genes appear to play important roles in the early development of bones and other tissues of the face. They are involved in making proteins that help make ribosomal RNA (rRNA). rRNA is a chemical needed to make new proteins that are necessary for normal function and survival of cells. Mutations in these genes can reduce the production of rRNA, which may cause cells involved in the development of facial bones and tissues to die early. This premature cell death may lead to the signs and symptoms of TCS. It is still unclear why the effects of these mutations are generally limited to facial development.[7808]","dateModified":"2014-10-27T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":7808,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Treacher Collins syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"June, 2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/treacher-collins-syndrome","dateAccessed":"2014-10-27T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":7848,"questionText":"How might Treacher Collins syndrome be treated?","answerText":"There is currently no cure for Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS).[7812] Treatment is tailored to the specific needs of each affected person.

However, more research is needed to determine if this type of treatment is effective and safe.[7812]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nResearchers are also studying the use of stems cells found in fat tissue to be used alongside surgery in people with TCS and other craniofacial disorders.
