Death may occur with more severe infections. Treatment might be recommended in certain cases of neurocysticercosis and depend on the number and location of cysts. For example, treatment might not be necessary for cases in which only one cysticeri is found. On the other hand, a person who has multiple cysticeri that are not calcified (i.e. dead) may require anti-parasitic treatment.&nbsp;Usually neurological symptoms such as swelling subside if the cysticeri die and shrink.[2249]","dateModified":"2010-04-12T13:21:00","references":[{"referenceId":2249,"authors":"Division of Parasitic Diseases.
