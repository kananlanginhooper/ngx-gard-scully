This condition is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=12\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner and is caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GSN\" target=\"_blank\">GSN</a></em> gene.[7020][7021] Treatment generally focuses on specific signs and symptoms.
