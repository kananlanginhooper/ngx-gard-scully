GCA most commonly affects the arteries of the head (especially the temporal arteries, located on each side of the head), but  arteries in other areas of the body can also become inflamed. The inflammation causes the arteries to narrow, resulting in poor blood flow.[9524] Signs and symptoms when arteries in the head are involved may include a throbbing headache on one side or the back of the head, tenderness of the scalp, flu-like symptoms, and/or problems with eyesight. Symptoms when other arteries are involved depend on the location of those arteries. The cause of GCA is still being studied, but it is thought to involve the immune system mistakenly attacking the artery walls. Several genetic and environmental factors may increase a person's risk to develop GCA. Complications of GCA may include permanent vision loss or a stroke, so treating the condition is important.

This means that a person may carry a genetic variation (or more than one genetic variation) that increases their risk to develop GCA, but  may also need one or more environmental triggers to develop GCA. Familial cases of GCA have been reported.[9527]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRecent studies have confirmed a strong association of GCA with genetic variations in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/geneFamily/hla\" target=\"_blank\">human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene family</a>, a cluster of genes on <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/6\" target=\"_blank\">chromosome 6</a>.[10130] The HLA gene family gives the body instructions to make a group of <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/howgeneswork/protein\" target=\"_blank\">proteins</a> known as the HLA complex. This complex helps the immune system distinguish between the body's own proteins and those made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.[10132] More specifically, GCA has been associated with genetic variations in the HLA class I and class II genes.[10130][10131] HLA class I genes give the body instructions to make proteins that occur on the surface of almost all cells. HLA class II genes give instructions to make proteins that occur almost exclusively on the surface of certain immune system cells.[10132]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVariations in other genes, which are not part of the HLA gene family, have also been associated with an increased risk to develop GCA. These include the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PTPN22\" target=\"_blank\">PTPN22</a></em>, <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/NLRP1\" target=\"_blank\">NLRP1</a></em>, <em><a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/603149\" target=\"_blank\">IL17A</a></em>, <em><a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/608678?search=IL33&amp;highlight=il33\" target=\"_blank\">IL33</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/137207?search=LRRC32&amp;highlight=lrrc32\" target=\"_blank\">LRRC32</a></em> genes. Outside of the HLA-related genes, certain variations in the&nbsp;<em>PTPN22</em> seem to be the most strongly associated with GCA.
