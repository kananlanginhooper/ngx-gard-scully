It is thought to occur when there is an over-production of elastin in a specific area of skin. Elastin is a protein that is a vital component of skin and other <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/connectivetissuedisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">connective tissues</a> throughout the body.

For example, elastin provides strength and flexibility to connective tissues; give structural support to organs and tissues such as the heart, skin, and lungs; and helps the skin return to its original position when it is poked or pinched (recoil).
