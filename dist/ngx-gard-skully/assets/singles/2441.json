Like other types of Gaucher disease, GD1 is caused when not enough glucocerebrosidase (GBA) is made. GBA is an important enzyme that breaks down a fatty chemical called glucocerebroside.[12741][12742][12743] Because the body cannot break down this chemical, fat-filled Gaucher <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/basics/cell\" target=\"_blank\">cells</a>  build up in areas like the spleen, liver and bone marrow.[12742] Unlike type 2 and 3, GD1 does not usually involve the brain and spinal cord (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/8679.htm\" target=\"_blank\">central nervous system</a>). Symptoms of GD1 include enlarged spleen and liver, low blood cell counts, bleeding problems and bone disease. The symptoms can range from mild to severe and may appear anytime from childhood to adulthood.

Her research includes clinical and basic research aspects of both Gaucher disease and Parkinson disease. Gaucher disease is a rare disorder caused by a hereditary deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase and is characterized by easy bruising, fatigue, anemia, low platelet count, and enlargement of the liver and spleen. Dr. Sidransky played a lead role in establishing the association between glucocerebrosidase and parkinsonism.","url":"https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=38966","lastModified":"2020-12-01T10:36:00","isFeatured":false},{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
