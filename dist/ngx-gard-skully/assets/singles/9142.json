Symptoms of eosinophilic gastroenteritis usually start in adulthood and may include stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, and the inability to absorb nutrients from food. Sometimes, a blockage in the intestines occurs. In most people, symptoms occur from time to time and may go away completely with treatment. The exact cause of eosinophilic gastroenteritis is unknown, but it may be due to an abnormal response of the immune system to food allergies. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, a clinical exam, laboratory tests, and by excluding other more common conditions. Treatment is focused on managing the symptoms and includes diet and medication.[15740][15741][15742][15743][15744]","dateModified":"2020-08-18T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":2092,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of eosinophilic gastroenteritis?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with eosinophilic gasteroenteritis.
