These glands are on top of each kidney and are responsible for producing certain <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/hormones.html\" target=\"_blank\">hormones</a> and keeping <a href=\"http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/AboutHighBloodPressure/Understanding-Blood-Pressure-Readings_UCM_301764_Article.jsp#.V9Gwd5grK00\" target=\"_blank\">blood pressure</a> at normal levels. Adrenocortical carcinoma is relatively frequent in children compared to many other cancers, although the cancer may also affect adults. Girls are more often affected than boys. Symptoms of adrenocortical carcinoma may include pain in the abdomen, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000468.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypertension</a>, weight gain, frequent urination and possibly deepening of the voice. These symptoms are due to the tumors causing excess secretion of hormones from the adrenal glands.[12165]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdrenocortical carcinoma may develop by chance alone, but at least 50% of the cancers are thought to be hereditary.
