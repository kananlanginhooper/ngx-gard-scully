It&nbsp;tends to grow rapidly and spread outside the testicle.&nbsp;Embryonal carcinomas&nbsp;are classified as nonseminoma germ cell tumors. Most testicular cancers grow from germ cells, the cells that make sperm. Germ cell tumors are broadly divided into seminomas and nonseminomas because each type has a different prognosis and treatment regimen. Nonseminomas, which are more common, tend to grow more quickly than seminomas. Nonseminoma tumors are often made up of more than one type of cell, and are identified according to the different cell types.[4926][4927]","dateModified":"2012-02-01T13:04:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":13022,"relatedDiseaseName":"Germ cells tumors","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":false}],"gardCases":[{"caseId":41818,"abbreviatedInquiry":"How long does this type of cancer take to get to stage four?","caseQuestions":[{"questionId":7100,"questionText":"How quickly do embryonal carcinomas progress to stage IV?","answerText":"Embyronal carcinomas are commonly described as&nbsp;rapidly progressive tumors, however diagnosis of advanced embryonal carcinoma is rare as symptoms tend to present early and prompt evaluation.[6286]&nbsp; While we did not find&nbsp;specific information regarding stage&nbsp;IV disease, one study reported&nbsp;a delayed diagnosis of&nbsp;134 days&nbsp;to be&nbsp;associated with stage III disease (101 days for stage II;&nbsp;75 days for stage I).[6285]","dateModified":"2013-10-18T17:25:00","references":[{"referenceId":6285,"authors":"Bosl GJ et al","articleTitle":"Impact of delay in diagnosis on clinical stage of testicular cancer","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"The Lancet","date":"October 1981;218(8253):970-973","url":"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2881%2991165-X/abstract","dateAccessed":"2013-10-18T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":6286,"authors":"López-González A et al","articleTitle":"Natural progression of embryonal carcinoma","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Arch Esp Urol","date":"2010 Nov;63(9):803-7","url":"http://www.aeurologia.com/pdfs/articulos/6702875825012-eng.pdf","dateAccessed":"2013-10-18T00:00:00"}]}]}],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
