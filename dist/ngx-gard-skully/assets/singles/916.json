While it is not uncommon for young children to have <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001585.htm\" target=\"_blank\">bowed legs</a>, typically the bowing improves with age.[11921][1069] There are two types of Blount disease (early-onset and late-onset), based on whether symptoms begin before or after four years of age.[11922] Blount disease may occur in one or both legs and can lead to  shortening of the affected leg and other changes within bones of the legs. The cause of Blount disease is not well understood; however, &nbsp;a variety of hereditary and genetic factors are likely involved. The condition is more common among certain populations and is associated with obesity and early walking.[11921][1352]&nbsp;Treatment may involve bracing and/or surgery.[11921]","dateModified":"2016-07-27T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
