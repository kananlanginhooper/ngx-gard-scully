The signs and symptoms of BHDS include&nbsp;characteristic up and down&nbsp;head movements that increase during walking and excitement and decrease during concentration.&nbsp;Although the specific cause of this condition is unknown, BHDS is often seen with cysts in the third ventricle of the brain that also&nbsp;cause hydrocephalus (water on the brain). Treatment for BHDS may involve surgical removal of the cyst causing the condition or using a shunt to drain excess water on the brain.[7113]","dateModified":"2014-01-22T17:15:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
