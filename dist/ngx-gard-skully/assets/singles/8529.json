This condition is congenital, meaning that babies are born with it. Although babies are born with the condition, macrodactyly is usually not inherited.[3485]&nbsp;Most of the time, only one hand is affected, but usually more than one finger&nbsp;is involved. Macrodactyly may also coexist with syndactyly (a condition in which two fingers are fused together) or clinodactyly (a condition in which a finger or more curves). Macrodactyly is deforming and can cause symptoms in some people. There have been cases of people with macrodactyly also having carpal tunnel syndrome. Surgery, usually involving multiple procedures, can help the condition.[3485]","dateModified":"2016-11-30T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
