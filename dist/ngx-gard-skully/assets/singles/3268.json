The signs and symptoms of this condition and the disease severity vary from person to person. The first sign of LP is usually a hoarse cry during infancy. Affected children then develop characteristic growths on the skin and <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=mucousmembrane\" target=\"_blank\">mucus membranes</a> in the first two years of life. Damage to the temporal lobes (the portions of the brain that process emotions and are important for short-term memory) occurs over time and&nbsp;can lead to seizures and intellectual disability.
