The pain lasts a few seconds to a few minutes, and usually on only one side of the face. It can also cause muscle spasms in the face the same time as the pain.[10673] The pain may result from a blood vessel pressing against the trigeminal nerve (the nerve that carries pain, feeling, and other sensations from the brain to the skin of the&nbsp;face), as a complication of multiple sclerosis, or due to compression of the nerve by a tumor or cyst. In some cases, the cause is unknown.[2526] Treatment options include medicines, surgery, and complementary approaches.[2527]</p>","dateModified":"2016-02-17T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":3625,"questionText":"How might trigeminal neuralgia be treated?","answerText":"<p target=\"_blank\" xmlns:ax=\"http://www.adam.com\" xmlns:adam=\"urn:DataProcessor\">Treatment options include medicines, surgery, and complementary approaches.[2527] </p>\r\n<p>Anticonvulsant medicines, which are used to block nerve firing, are generally effective in treating trigeminal neuralgia.&nbsp;

Typical analgesics and opioids are not usually helpful in treating the sharp, recurring pain caused by trigeminal neuralgia.&nbsp; If medication fails to relieve pain or produces intolerable side effects, surgical treatment may be recommended.[2527] </p>\r\n<p>Several neurosurgical procedures are available to treat trigeminal neuralgia.&nbsp; The choice among the various types depends on the nature of the pain, the patient's preference, physical well-being, general health, previous surgeries, presence of multiple sclerosis, and area of trigeminal nerve involvement.&nbsp; Some procedures are done on an outpatient basis, while others may involve a more complex operation that is performed under general anesthesia.&nbsp; Some degree of facial numbness is expected after most of these procedures, and&nbsp;trigeminal neuralgia&nbsp;might return despite the procedure&rsquo;s initial success.&nbsp; Depending on the procedure, other surgical risks include hearing loss, balance problems, infection, and stroke.[2527] </p>\r\n<p>A <em>rhizotomy</em> is a procedure in which select nerve fibers are destroyed to block pain.&nbsp; A rhizotomy for&nbsp;trigeminal neuralgia&nbsp;causes some degree of permanent sensory loss and facial numbness.&nbsp; Several forms of rhizotomy are available to treat&nbsp;trigeminal neuralgia:[2527] </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <div><em>Balloon compression</em> works by injuring the insulation on nerves that are involved with the sensation of light touch on the face.</div>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <div><em>Glycerol injection</em> involves bathing the ganglion (the central part of the nerve from which the nerve impulses are transmitted) and damaging the insulation of trigeminal nerve fibers. </div>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <div><em>Radiofrequency thermal lesioning</em> involves gradually heating part of the nerve&nbsp;with an electrode, injuring the nerve fibers. </div>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <div><em>Stereotactic radiosurgery</em> uses computer imaging to direct highly focused beams of radiation at the site where the trigeminal nerve exits the brainstem.&nbsp;

While viewing the trigeminal nerve through a microscope, the surgeon moves away the vessels that are compressing the nerve and places a soft cushion between the nerve and the vessels.&nbsp; Unlike rhizotomies, there is usually no numbness in the face after this surgery.&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">A&nbsp;</span><em style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">neurectomy</em><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">, which involves cutting part of the nerve, may be performed during microvascular decompression if no vessel is found to be pressing on the trigeminal nerve.[2527]</span><br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome patients choose to manage&nbsp;trigeminal neuralgia&nbsp;using complementary techniques. This is usually done in combination with drug treatment. &nbsp;For some, low-impact exercise, yoga, creative visualization, aromatherapy, or medication helps.
