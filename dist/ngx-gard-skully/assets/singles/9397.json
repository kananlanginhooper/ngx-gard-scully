The age of the woman and whether she has a hereditary cancer syndrome may be factors in deciding the best course of treatment.[15032] For women who are past the age of menopause, it is recommended that both ovaries, fallopian tubes and the uterus be removed. Younger women may want to consider less surgery to help preserve fertility and keep one working ovary.[15030] Additional treatment may depend on the stage of the cancer and the extent it has spread beyond the ovary.","dateModified":"2018-10-25T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":15028,"authors":"Borah T, Mahanta RK, Bora BD, Saikia S","articleTitle":"Brenner tumor of the ovary: An incidental finding","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Midlife Health","date":"2011 Jan-Jun","volume":"291","pages":"40-41","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156501","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15029,"authors":"Douherty D, Onyemkpa C, Engel M, Oyasijic T","articleTitle":"A case report of an incidental Brenner tumor found after resection of a large ovarian mucinous neoplasm","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Int J Surg Case Rep","date":"2018","volume":"49","pages":"40-43","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6039703","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15030,"authors":"Nasioudis D, Sisti G, Holcomb K, Kanninen T, Witkin S","articleTitle":"Malignant Brenner tumors of the ovary; a population-based analysis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Gynecol Oncol","date":"2016","volume":"142","pages":"44-49","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27130406","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15032,"authors":"Lang SM, Mills AM, Cantrell LA","articleTitle":"Malignant Brenner tumor of the ovary: Review and case report","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Gynecol Oncol Reports","date":"2017","volume":"22","pages":"26-31","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5608552","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":2080,"questionText":"What is the long-term outlook for individuals with Brenner tumors of the ovary?","answerText":"For individuals with non-cancerous Brenner tumors, and no other findings, there is a good to excellent long-term outlook.
