Management of BCS may include monitoring for vision loss, hearing loss, and the development of muscle or skeletal problems. Measures to prevent corneal rupture, such as wearing special protective glasses, may help delay vision loss. Other treatments may include corrective lenses (glasses), hearing aids, correcting hip dysplasia, and repairing retinal detachment.[15303]","dateModified":"2019-03-05T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":162,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of brittle cornea syndrome (BCS)?<br />","answerText":"The symptoms of brittle cornea syndrome (BCS)<span>&nbsp;</span>can vary, even among family members.[15303][4974][4973] The most common symptom is thinning of the cornea (<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6824/keratoconus\">keratoconus</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-642-35951-4_542-2\" target=\"_blank\">keratoglobus</a>)&nbsp;often leading to tearing and rupture after minor injury.
