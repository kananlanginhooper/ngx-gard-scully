Rarely, mutations are inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=209\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked</a>  pattern. If mutations are identified in either parent, the risk for inheritance is dependent on the sex of the parent and the child. At most, the risk would be 50%. If the mutation is not found in either parent, then the risk for a sibling to be affected is low.&nbsp;&nbsp;[2597]<br />","dateModified":"2015-12-03T00:00:00","references":[{"referenceId":2597,"authors":"Clinton, C &  Gazda, HT","articleTitle":"Diamond Blackfan Anemia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7047/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}]}],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
