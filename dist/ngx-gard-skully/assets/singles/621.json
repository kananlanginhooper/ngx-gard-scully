Affected people have <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/anemia.html\" target=\"_blank\">anemia</a>, which can cause pale skin, weakness, fatigue, and more serious complications. Two types of alpha-thalassemia can cause health problems: the more severe type is known as Hb Bart syndrome; the milder form is called HbH disease. Hb Bart syndrome may be characterized by <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007308.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hydrops fetalis</a>; severe anemia; <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/17215.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hepatosplenomegaly</a>; heart defects; and abnormalities of the urinary system or genitalia. Most babies with this condition are stillborn or die soon after birth. HbH disease may cause mild to moderate anemia; hepatosplenomegaly; <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/jaundice.html\" target=\"_blank\">jaundice</a>; or bone changes. Alpha-thalassemia typically results from <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=45\" target=\"_blank\">deletions</a> involving the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HBA1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>HBA1</em></a> and <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HBA2\" target=\"_blank\"><em>HBA2</em></a> genes. The inheritance is complex, and can be read about <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/alpha-thalassemia#inheritance\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.[3457] No treatment is effective for Hb Bart syndrome. For HbH disease, occasional red blood cell transfusions may be needed.[3458]","dateModified":"2015-07-29T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":9192,"questionText":"How is alpha-thalassemia inherited?","answerText":"The inheritance of alpha-thalassemia is complex because the condition involves two genes: <em>HBA1</em> and <em>HBA2</em>. People have two copies of the <em>HBA1</em> gene and two copies of the <em>HBA2</em> gene in each cell. Each copy is called an allele. Therefore, there are 4 alleles that produce alpha-globin, the protein that results from these genes. For each of the 2 genes, one allele is inherited from a person's father, and the other is inherited from a person's mother - so each person inherits 2 alleles from each parent. The different types of alpha-thalassemia result from the loss of some or all of these alleles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf both parents are missing at least one alpha-globin allele, each of their children are at risk of having Hb Bart syndrome or <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/2783/hydrops-fetalis/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">hydrops fetalis</a>, hemoglobin H (HbH) disease, or alpha-thalassemia trait. The precise risk depends on how many alleles are missing and which combination of the <em>HBA1</em> and <em>HBA2</em> genes is affected.[3457]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn most cases:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>a person with 1 mutated allele is a carrier and has no signs or symptoms</li>\r\n    <li>a person with 2 mutated alleles may have mild signs or symptoms of alpha-thalassemia (called alpha-thalassemia minor, or alpha-thalassemia trait)</li>\r\n    <li>a person with 3 mutated alleles has moderate to severe symptoms (called HbH disease)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When there are 4 mutated alleles, the condition is called alpha-thalassemia major or hydrops fetalis. In these cases, an affected fetus usually does not survive to birth, or an affected newborn does not survive long after birth.[9408]</p>","dateModified":"2015-07-29T11:28:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[{"referenceId":3457,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Alpha thalassemia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"August 2009","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/alpha-thalassemia","dateAccessed":"2012-01-23T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":9408,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Thalassemia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Mayo Clinic","date":"January 2, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thalassemia/basics/causes/con-20030316","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":5911,"questionText":"How might alpha-thalassemia be treated?","answerText":"Treatment of alpha-thalassemia often&nbsp;includes&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/bt/\" target=_blank>blood transfusions</a>&nbsp;to provide healthy blood cells that have normal hemoglobin.&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003009.htm\" target=_blank>Bone marrow transplant</a> has helped to cure a small number of individuals with severe alpha-thalassemia.[4899]","dateModified":"2012-01-25T22:16:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":4899,"authors":"National Heart Lung and Blood Institute","articleTitle":"Thalassemias","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"How Are Thalassemias Treated?","date":"August 1, 2010","url":"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/thalassemia/treatment.html","dateAccessed":"2012-01-23T00:00:00"}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12455,"relatedDiseaseName":"Hemoglobinopathy","relation":"Parent","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":7756,"relatedDiseaseName":"Thalassemia","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
