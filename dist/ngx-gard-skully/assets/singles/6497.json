Some have suggested that mild placental insufficiency may be the cause of these risks. Sonograms of the baby during the third trimester might be appropriate and used to monitor fetal growth and development. Another risk associated with maternal PG is the placental trasnder of the PG antibody, resulting in neonatal PG; this occurs in about 5 to 10 percent of babies.&nbsp; The blisters resolve spontaneously without scarring over a period of weeks as the maternal PG antibodies are cleared by the baby. Babies with neonatal PG should be monitored for bacterial infections of the lesions.
