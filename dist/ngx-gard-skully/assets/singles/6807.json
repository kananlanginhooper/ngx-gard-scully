It typically becomes apparent at birth or in infancy, causing severe pain with movement; progressive joint contractures which limit movement; thickened skin; and hyperpigmented patches over prominences of the joints. Other features may include digestive problems; gum enlargement; skin bumps; pearly <a href=\"http://c.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/papule\" target=\"_blank\">papules</a> on the face and neck; and masses near the anus (perianal masses). Complications can be life threatening. Many children with the severe form (previously called <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/infantile-systemic-hyalinosis\" target=\"_blank\">infantile systemic hyalinosis</a>) die in early childhood, while some with a milder form (previously called <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/juvenile-hyaline-fibromatosis\" target=\"_blank\">juvenile hyaline fibromatosis</a>) survive into adulthood.[10364] HFS is caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ANTXR2\" target=\"_blank\"><em>ANTXR2</em></a> gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> manner.[10365] Treatment is supportive and aims to alleviate pain and other signs and symptoms of the condition.[10364]","dateModified":"2016-01-07T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":9932,"questionText":"How is hyaline fibromatosis syndrome inherited?","answerText":"Hyaline fibromatosis syndrome&nbsp;is inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" tabindex=\"-1\">autosomal recessive</a>&nbsp;manner.[10364] This means that to be affected, a person must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" tabindex=\"-1\">mutation</a>&nbsp;in both copies of the responsible&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" tabindex=\"-1\">gene</a>&nbsp;in each cell.

The long-term outlook (prognosis) for people with HFS depends on how severely a person is affected. Overall, the prognosis is poor, especially for those with systemic involvement.[10370] The disorder typically progresses, with the continual appearance of new lesions.[10371] However, even within severe and mild forms, the degree of severity and specific signs and symptoms can vary. This spectrum of severity and features is the reason that the terms 'hyaline fibromatosis syndrome' or 'inherited systemic hyalinosis' are now used, rather than terms defining severe (infantile) and milder (juvenile) forms as distinct entities.[10364]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChildren with severe forms (previously called <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/infantile-systemic-hyalinosis\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">infantile systemic hyalinosis</a>) often don't survive past early childhood. Some with milder forms (previously called <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/juvenile-hyaline-fibromatosis\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">juvenile hyaline fibromatosis</a>) survive into adulthood.[10364] Although joint contractures, skin hyperpigmentation, and lesions occur with the milder form, the other features may vary, the pain is less severe, and disability may be less pronounced. Pain may lessen with age.[10364] Risks of potentially life-threatening complications in people with HFS may be due to persistent diarrhea, infections, and malnutrition.[10371] There is currently no cure for HFS, and treatment generally aims to alleviate signs and symptoms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile cognitive function is typically normal, cases of delayed development have been reported.[10364]","dateModified":"2016-01-08T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Prognosis","references":[{"referenceId":10364,"authors":"Joseph TC Shieh, H Eugene Hoyme, and Laura T Arbour","articleTitle":"Hyalinosis, Inherited Systemic","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"April 11, 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1525/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":10370,"authors":"Bernárdez C, Martinez Barba E, Kutzner H, Requena L","articleTitle":"A mild case of hyaline fibromatosis syndrome, presenting in an adult","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol","date":"March 23, 2015","volume":"[Epub ahead of print]","pages":"","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":10371,"authors":"Van Raak SM, Meuffels DE, Van Leenders GJ, Oei EH","articleTitle":"Hyaline fibromatosis of Hoffa's fat pad in a patient with a mild type of hyaline fibromatosis syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Skeletal Radiol","date":"April, 2014","volume":"43(4)","pages":"531-534","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
