In this condition, the shape of the cornea slowly changes from the normal round shape to a cone shape. Most people who develop keratoconus start out nearsighted, which&nbsp;tends to&nbsp;become worse over time. The earliest symptom is a slight blurring of vision that cannot be corrected with glasses.  Over time, there may be eye halos, glare, or other night vision problems.The cause is unknown, but the tendency to develop keratoconus is probably present from birth. Keratoconus is thought to involve a defect in collagen, the tissue that makes up most of the cornea. Some researchers believe that allergy and eye rubbing may play a role.[3643] Treatment for keratoconus depends on the severity of your condition and how quickly the condition is progressing.\r\nMild to moderate keratoconus can be treated with eyeglasses or contact lenses.\r\nIn some people the cornea becomes scarred or wearing contact lenses becomes difficult. In these cases, surgery might be necessary.[11018]","dateModified":"2016-03-23T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":10383,"questionText":"What causes keratoconus?","answerText":"The exact cause of keratoconus is unknown. Both genetic and environmental factors may play a role in the development of keratoconus. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe genetic factors involve abnormalities in the structure of collagen, which result in a weak and flexible cornea. Keratoconus is more common in people with <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10247/down-syndrome/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">Down syndrome</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/6975/marfan-syndrome/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">Marfan syndrome</a>, and <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/634/leber-congenital-amaurosis/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">Leber congenital amaurosis</a>, and certain genetic conditions. In these cases, the cause depends on the specific condition.[11046]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnvironmental factors may include living in sunny, hot areas of the world, while eye-rubbing is a major behavioral factor in the disease.  Malfunctioning enzymes that normally help maintain the health of the cornea may play a role.  All of these factors contribute to the main problem in keratoconus, which is the defective collagen structure that results in thinning and irregularity of the cornea.   Keratoconus occurs more frequently in patients with atopy (asthma and eczema) or severe ocular allergies. It may also be linked to hormonal factors because it is more frequent during puberty and also may progress during pregnancy.[11046]","dateModified":"2016-04-15T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":11046,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Keratoconus treatment","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"American Academy of Ophthalmology","date":"March, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/keratoconus-treatment","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":10384,"questionText":"How is keratoconus treated?","answerText":"Treatment depends on the severity of the keratoconus symptoms and may include: :[11042][11047]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Eyeglasses and contact lens: During early stages, vision can be corrected with eyeglasses.
