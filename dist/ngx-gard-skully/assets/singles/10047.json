The primary symptom of mild glutathione synthetase deficiency affects the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/blood.html\">red blood cells</a>. People with the mild form of the deficiency may have red blood cells that are broken down too quickly, and new red blood cells are not made quickly enough to replace them.

The build up of certain substances in the body can also cause&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000335.htm\" target=\"_blank\">metabolic acidosis</a>, which happens when there is too much acid in the body. Signs of metabolic acidosis may include nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.[14619]&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe severe form of glutathione synthetase deficiency usually causes the same signs and symptoms seen in the milder forms of the deficiency, but can also affect the brain, which causes neurological problems. Neurological problems may include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/seizures.html\">seizures</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001523.htm\">intellectual disability</a>, and trouble coordinating movements (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003198.htm\">ataxia</a>).
