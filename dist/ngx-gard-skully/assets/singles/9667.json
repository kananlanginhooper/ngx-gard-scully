Signs and symptoms vary, but often include confusion, anterograde amnesia (difficulty learning new information following the onset of amnesia), short-term memory loss, and seizures.&nbsp;Diagnosis often involves <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/9587.htm\" target=_blank>lumbar puncture</a>, virus testing, and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/mriscans.html\" target=_blank>MRI</a>. <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003931.htm\" target=_blank>EEG</a>'s may also be recommended&nbsp;when seizures are suspected.
