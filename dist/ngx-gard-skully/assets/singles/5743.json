It most commonly arises in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.entnet.org/content/salivary-glands\" target=\"_blank\">major and minor salivary glands</a>&nbsp;of the head and neck.[7974] It can also occur in the breast, uterus, or other locations in the body.[7974][7975] Symptoms depend on the tumor's location. Salivary gland tumors may cause painless masses in the mouth or face. Tumors of the <a href=\"https://www.aao.org/eye-health/anatomy/lacrimal-gland\" target=\"_blank\">lacrimal gland</a> may cause a bulging eye or changes in vision. Those affecting the windpipe or voice box may cause respiratory symptoms or changes in speech, respectively.[7975] Advanced tumors may cause pain and/or nerve paralysis, as ACC often spreads along the nerves.[7974][7975] It may also spread through the bloodstream. It spreads to the lymph nodes in about 5% to 10% of cases.[7974] The cause of ACC is currently unknown. It typically does not run in families. Treatment depends on many factors and may include surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy.[7974][7975] Unfortunately,&nbsp;ACC is typically an aggressive form of cancer that has a poor long-term outlook.[13517]<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2017-06-21T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":8013,"questionText":"What causes adenoid cystic carcinoma?","answerText":"The underlying cause of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is not yet known, but it appears to develop from non-inherited, genetic changes that occur during a person's lifetime.
