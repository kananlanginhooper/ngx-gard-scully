People with this disorder experience prolonged bleeding following an injury, surgery, or having a tooth pulled. In severe cases, heavy bleeding occurs after minor trauma or in the absence of injury. Serious complications can result from bleeding into the joints, muscles, brain, or other internal organs. The major types of this disorder are <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/6591/Hemophilia_A__congenital.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">hemophilia A</a> and <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/8732/Hemophilia_B.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">hemophilia B</a>.
