Since few cases of 4q duplication have been described in the literature, it is difficult to predict severity or the specific features that a person will have.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSomeone with a small duplication may be very mildly affected and have no developmental delays. Others, even within the same family, may have varying degrees of developmental delay, any of several types of birth defects, and/or distinctive facial features.[9077]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile very few cases have been described, it seems that those with a very small duplication of material close to the middle of the chromosome (called a proximal duplication) are usually healthy with developmental delay and/or learning difficulties.
