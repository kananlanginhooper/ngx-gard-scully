Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>25% chance to be affected</li>\r\n    <li>50% chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent</li>\r\n    <li>25% chance to be unaffected&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;not a carrier</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSome cases of BBS (fewer than 10%) appear to require the presence of at least three mutations for a person to have features of the condition. This is known as <a href=\"http://genetics.thetech.org/ask-a-geneticist/triallelic-diseases-and-inheritance\" target=\"_blank\">triallelic inheritance</a>.[2015] In these cases, in addition to inheriting a mutation in the same gene from each parent, a child also needs to have at least one more mutation in another gene to be affected.","dateModified":"2017-09-18T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[{"referenceId":2015,"authors":"Forsythe E, Beales PL","articleTitle":"Bardet-Biedl Syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1363/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}]}],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
