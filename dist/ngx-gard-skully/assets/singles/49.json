Cutis laxa is characterized by skin that is loose (lax), wrinkled, sagging, and lacking elasticity. The specific symptoms and the severity of De Barsy syndrome can vary greatly. Features that may be seen include eye abnormalities, growth abnormalities, and a prematurely-aged appearance. Distinctive facial features, skeletal malformations, and neurological abnormalities may also occur. [4599] Some cases of De Barsy syndrome have been linked to mutations in either the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PYCR1\" target=\"_blank\">PYCR1</a></em> or <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ALDH18A1\" target=\"_blank\">ALDH18A1</a>&nbsp;</em>genes.
