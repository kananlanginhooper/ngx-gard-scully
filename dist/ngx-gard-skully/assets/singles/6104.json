CLL usually occurs in adults around the age of 70 and begins in the bone marrow and then spreads to the blood. Over time, CLL may also spread to the lymph nodes and other organs, including the liver, spleen and lungs. The severity and outcome of CLL depends on many factors. The underlying cause is thought to be a combination of genetic and other unknown factors. It usually occurs in people with no family history of the condition, but familial cases have been reported. CLL is diagnosed based on the symptoms and various blood tests.
