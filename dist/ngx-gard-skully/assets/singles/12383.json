[10696][10697] Though the severity and age of onset can vary, most patients begin having symptoms within the first decade of life. Symptoms may include the following: recurrent <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/stroke.html\" target=\"_blank\">strokes</a>, fevers, muscle pain, an enlarged liver or spleen, and areas of skin discoloration known as livedo racemosa or <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/2524.htm\" target=\"_blank\">livedo reticularis</a>.
