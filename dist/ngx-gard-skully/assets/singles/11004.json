The dark streaks appear along the lines of normal skin development (lines of Blaschko). LWNH typically spreads for one to two years and then becomes stable. The dark streaks sometimes fade with age. Most of the time, only the skin is affected, but other conditions, such as growth, developmental, or heart problems may be present. The cause for LWNH is unknown. Genetic factors, especially chromosomal <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001317.htm\" target=\"_blank\">mosaicism,</a> may be involved. LWNH is not thought to be inherited. It is diagnosed based on the symptoms. There is no specific treatment for the skin findings in LWNH because they are not associated with any medical problem.[12958][15554][15555]&nbsp;&nbsp;","dateModified":"2020-05-12T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6805,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of linear and whorled nevoid hypermelanosis?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with linear and whorled nevoid hypermelanosis (LWNH).
