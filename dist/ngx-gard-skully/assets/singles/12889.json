It appears to be more common in boys than girls.[10330] Children with this condition have difficulty planning and producing the precise, refined, and specific movements of the tongue, lips, jaw, and palate that are necessary for intelligible speech.[10331]&nbsp;In many cases, the underlying cause of childhood apraxia of speech is unknown (idiopathic).[10330][10331][10332] Some cases are associated with a known neurological cause (such as intrauterine or early childhood stroke, infection, trauma, brain cancer or tumor resection, traumatic brain injury, etc.), and other cases occur as part of a complex neurobehavioral disorder (such as <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Fact-Sheet\" target=\"_blank\">autism</a>, epilepsy, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6464/fragile-x-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">fragile X syndrome</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/2424/galactosemia\" target=\"_blank\">galactosemia</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/5696/rett-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Rett syndrome</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/5575/prader-willi-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Prader-Willi syndrome</a> or certain types of <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/guides/pages/73/faqs-about-chromosome-disorders\" target=\"_blank\">chromosome abnormalities</a>).[10330] In some cases, <span>researchers have found alterations (mutations) in the<em> <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FOXP2\" target=\"_blank\">FOXP2</a></em> gene or loss of genetic material involving this gene.</span>[13462] Treatment of childhood apraxia of speech involves speech therapy with a speech-language pathologist. Those with more severe cases will require more therapy than those with mild cases.[10331] The goal of therapy is to increase speech production and intelligibility. In some cases, augmentative and alternative forms of communication may be needed.[10332]","dateModified":"2017-05-30T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":5838,"relatedDiseaseName":"Apraxia","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
