Up to a third of children with ASD/ID may also develop seizures in childhood, around of after 12 months of age.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Signs and symptoms depend on the specific condition and severity in each person. Some children with an SCN2A related disorder do not fit directly into one of these major forms.[14699]&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Most children with </span><em style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">SCN2A</em><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> mutations will have seizures that start in the first few weeks of life. Other symptoms of an </span><em style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">SCN2A</em><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> related disorder may include feeding or gastrointestinal problems, developmental delay, movement disorders, and/or poor muscle tone (hypotonia).[13756]</span></span></p>\r\n<em>SCN2A</em> mutations may be inherited from a parent or may occur for the first time in a child with an <em>SCN2A</em> related disorder (a <em>de novo</em> mutation).&nbsp;Treatment depends on symptoms and severity, but often includes antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).[13756] Unfortunately, in many cases, seizures associated with SCN2A related disorders cannot be controlled, even with the use of multiple&nbsp;AEDs. However, for infants who begin to have seizures within 3 months of birth, nonselective sodium channel blockers (such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682022.html\" target=\"_blank\">phenytoin</a> and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682237.html\" target=\"_blank\">carbamazepine</a>) are more effective.
