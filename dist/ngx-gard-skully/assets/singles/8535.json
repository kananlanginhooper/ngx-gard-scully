It have two forms of presentation, a classic form that usually begin shortly after birth in newborns, and a milder later-onset presentaition in toddlers, children and adults. Affected infants hypoventilate upon falling asleep and exhibit a bluish appearance of the skin or lips (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003215.htm\" target=\"_blank\">cyanosis</a>).

However, over 90% of cases are due to a new mutation in the affected person and are not inherited from a parent. Diagnosis is made with the clinical symptoms and the genetic test showing the variation in the <em>PHOX2B</em> gene.
