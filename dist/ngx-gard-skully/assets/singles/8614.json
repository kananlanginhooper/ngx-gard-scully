The sickle cells also get stuck in blood vessels, blocking blood flow.[2768] Signs and symptoms of sickle cell disease usually begin in early childhood and may include anemia, repeated infections, and periodic episodes of pain (called crises). This condition is caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>&nbsp;in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HBB\" target=\"_blank\">HBB</a></em> gene and is inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> pattern.[2767] Treatment typically focuses on controlling symptoms and may include pain medicines during crises; <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682004.html\" target=\"_blank\">hydroxyurea</a>&nbsp;to reduce the number of pain episodes;&nbsp;antibiotics and vaccines to prevent bacterial infections; and blood transfusions.[2768] On July 7, 2017, the FDA in the United States approved the use of <a href=\"https://www.drugs.com/history/endari.html\" target=\"_blank\">Endari</a> (prescription grade L-glutamine) to reduce the number of sickle cell crisis.

When two people who are carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have a child, there is a 25% (1 in 4) chance that the child will have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) chance that the child will be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% (1 in 4) chance that the child will not have the condition and not be a carrier.","dateModified":"2015-12-14T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[{"referenceId":2767,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Sickle cell disease","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"August 2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/sickle-cell-disease","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}],"references":[{"referenceId":8544,"authors":"Vichinsky EP","articleTitle":"Variant sickle cell syndromes","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"March 28, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.uptodate.com/contents/variant-sickle-cell-syndromes","dateAccessed":"2015-03-20T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12455,"relatedDiseaseName":"Hemoglobinopathy","relation":"Parent","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12456,"relatedDiseaseName":"Sickle cell disease and related disorders","relation":"Parent","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":false}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":666,"dateCreated":"2019-10-02T11:13:00","publishDate":"2019-10-02T00:00:00","title":"NIH Creates New Vector for Improved Gene Therapy in Sickle Cell Disease","description":"Researchers at the National Institutes of Health have developed a new and improved viral vector&mdash;a virus-based vehicle that delivers therapeutic genes&mdash;for use in gene therapy for sickle cell disease.
