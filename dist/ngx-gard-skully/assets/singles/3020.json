About 12 percent of people with this condition experience symptoms that vary greatly in severity. Seizures and headaches are the most common symptoms of AVMs but individuals can also experience a wide range of other neurological symptoms. AVMs can cause hemorrhage (bleeding) in the brain, which can be fatal. Symptoms can appear at any age, but are most often noticed when people are in their twenties, thirties, or forties. The cause of AVMs is not yet well understood but it is believed that AVMs result from mistakes that occur during embryonic or fetal development. Medication is used to treat general symptoms such as headache, back pain, and seizures caused by AVMs. However, the best treatment for AVMs is often surgery or <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007274.htm\">sterotactic radiosurgery</font></a>.[5272]</p>","dateModified":"2012-06-18T15:22:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[{"caseId":37860,"abbreviatedInquiry":"My sister died of a massive stroke caused by an AVM in her early 60's.
