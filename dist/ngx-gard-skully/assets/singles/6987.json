A diagnosis of mastocytosis that causes skin lesions may be confirmed by a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003840.htm\">skin biopsy</a>&nbsp;of the lesion. During a skin biopsy, a sample of skin tissue is taken and looked at under a microscope for the presence of dense areas of mast cells. If there are no cutaneous lesions or if the skin biopsy reveals uncertain results, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003934.htm\">bone marrow biopsy</a>&nbsp;may be performed.
