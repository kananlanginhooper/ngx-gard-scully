This typically occurs immediately to 15 to 30 minutes after eating. Rumination often occurs without retching or gagging. Rumination may be proceeded by a feeling of pressure, the need to belch, nausea, or discomfort. Some people with rumination disorder experience bloating, heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, headaches, dizziness, or sleeping difficulties.

This ultimately results in the relaxation of the muscle at the bottom of the esophagus. To relieve this discomfort people with rumination disorder use abdominal wall muscles to expel and regurgitate foods. As a result of the relief of symptoms, the person repeats the same response when the discomfort returns. Overtime the person unconsciously adopts this learned behavior.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome cases of rumination disorder occur without a precipitating event or illness. Other people with the disorder describe also having ingestion, which may serve as a trigger. Studies have shown that some people with rumination disorder also have depression, anxiety, or an eating disorder.  These conditions may likewise play a role in rumination disorder.  Conditions like depression and anxiety are known to be more common in people with other functional gastrointestinal conditions as well, for example irritable bowel syndrome.[8742]<br />","dateModified":"2015-04-23T16:07:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":8742,"authors":"Mousa HM, Montgomery M, Alioto A","articleTitle":"Adolescent rumination syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Curr Gastroenterol Rep","date":"2014 Aug","volume":"16(8)","pages":"398","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25064317","dateAccessed":"2015-04-23T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":8637,"questionText":"How is rumination disorder diagnosed?","answerText":"<p>Diagnosis can be made by a clinical evaluation of the person&rsquo;s signs and symptoms and history.
