Males with PMDS have normal testes and normal male external genitals. However, they also have a uterus and fallopian tubes (<a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/parent/general/body_basics/female_reproductive_system.html#a_Components_of_the_Female_Reproductive_System\" target=\"_blank\">female reproductive organs</a>). Early signs of PMDS may include <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000973.htm\" target=\"_blank\">undescended testes</a> (cryptorchidism) or <a href=\"http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/inguinal-hernia/Pages/facts.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">inguinal hernias</a>. The uterus and fallopian tubes are found by accident during surgery to treat these conditions. Other features of PMDS may include infertility and an increased risk for testicular cancer. PMDS occurs due to genetic variants in either the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/AMH\" target=\"_blank\">AMH</a></em> gene (PMDS type 1) or <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/AMHR2\" target=\"_blank\">AMHR2</a></em> gene (PMDS type 2).

Diagnosis of PMDS is based on the symptoms, clinical exam, and imaging studies. The results of genetic testing may also be helpful for diagnosis.
