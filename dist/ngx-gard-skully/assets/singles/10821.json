Most people who are infected have no symptoms, but some may develop fever, headaches, and vomiting. Symptoms occur within 4-10 days of being infected and most recover in 1-2 weeks. A small number will develop swelling of the brain and severe neurological symptoms that can be permanent. Triple E can also lead to coma and death. This condition is caused by a type of arbovirus and is transmitted by a mosquito which has bitten an infected bird or reptile. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, specific findings in the blood, and occasionally by an MRI of the brain. There is no specific treatment for Triple E. It is managed by taking care of the symptoms. Prevention includes avoiding mosquito bites and controlling mosquito populations.[15455][15457][15459][15460]<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2020-04-02T12:33:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13361,"questionText":"What are the symptoms of eastern equine encephalitis?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with eastern equine encephalitis (Triple E) virus infections.
