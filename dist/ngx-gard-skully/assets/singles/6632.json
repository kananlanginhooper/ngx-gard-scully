Symptoms usually begin in childhood and may last a few days or longer. Signs and symptoms may include stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting. People with hereditary pancreatitis develop chronic pancreatitis, a constantly inflamed pancreas. This leads to symptoms which may include fatty stools, weight loss, and poor absorption of nutrients from food. Adults with hereditary pancreatitis are at an increased risk for type 1 diabetes and pancreatic cancer.
