These tumors usually grow on or just underneath the skin, but neurofibromas can also grow in other places in the body and may even affect multiple nerves. Some of these tumors can cause skin irritation, nerve damage, or affect a person&rsquo;s appearance. In addition, some of these tumors may become cancerous.
