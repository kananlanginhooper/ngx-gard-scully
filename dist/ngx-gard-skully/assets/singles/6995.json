This leads to over-production of several hormones, resulting in the signs and symptoms of MAS.[1427][3770]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrecocious puberty in McCune-Albright syndrome is gonadotropin-independent. This means that it is not caused by early release of gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone), but, instead, the cause is the early secretion of high levels of sex hormones (male androgens and female estrogens). Precocious puberty caused by this condition is much more common in girls than in boys, resulting from an excess of estrogen produced by cysts in the ovaries.[1427][12159] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther endocrine problems that may also occur in people with McCune-Albright syndrome are hyperthyroidism, acromegaly and Cushing syndrome. The hyperthyroidism in the MAS is caused by an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) or by thyroid masses called nodules. Acromegaly results from an excess of growth hormone produced by the pituitary gland (a structure at the base of the brain that makes several hormones).<span>&nbsp; </span>Cushing syndrome results from an excess of the hormone cortisol produced by the adrenal glands.[1427]<br />","dateModified":"2018-03-22T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":1427,"authors":"","articleTitle":"McCune-Albright syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"MedlinePlus Genetics","date":"January 2009","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/mccune-albright-syndrome","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":3770,"authors":"","articleTitle":"GNAS Complex Locus","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man – OMIM web site","date":"September 29, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://omim.org/entry/139320","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":2309,"questionText":"Is McCune-Albright syndrome inherited?","answerText":"<strong>McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is not inherited.</strong> It is caused by a random, <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=46586\" target=\"_blank\">somatic mutation</a>&nbsp;in the <em>GNAS</em> gene.
