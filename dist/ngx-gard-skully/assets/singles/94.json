As a result, these materials accumulate in cells leading to the various signs and symptoms of the condition. Most people with mucolipidosis type 4 develop severe psychomotor (mental and motor skills) delay by the end of the first year of life and visual impairment that worsens over time. Other common features of the condition include limited or absent speech; intellectual disability; <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003298.htm\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">hypotonia</a> that gradually progresses to <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003297.htm\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">spasticity</a>; problems controlling hand movements; impaired production of stomach acids; and iron deficiency. Approximately 5% of affected people have a mild form of the condition (known as atypical mucolipidosis type 4) which is associated with milder psychomotor delay and less severe eye abnormalities.
