This vitamin supports the development of the bones of the body, so when there are low levels of vitamin D, the bones are not strong enough. Symptoms of osteomalacia can include muscle weakness, bone pain, and walking with a waddling gait. Pain is especially likely to occur in the lower back, hips, and legs. The weakening of the bones may also cause them to easily fracture.[12254]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOsetomalacia can be caused by having a low level of vitamin D in the diet or lack of sun exposure. The condition may also be the result of an underlying disease such as <a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/celiac-disease/Pages/overview.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">celiac disease</a>, or kidney or liver disorders.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiagnosis of osteomalacia is possible through blood or urine tests to check for vitamin D levels or a <a href=\"http://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info.cfm?pg=bonebiopsy\" target=\"_blank\">bone biopsy</a>. Treatment options include supplementing the diet with more vitamin D or calcium.
