Under the microscope, this condition looks very similar to a condition that occurs on the breast called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dermnetnz.org/site-age-specific/paget.html\" target=\"_blank\">mammary Paget disease</a>.[1002] The primary difference between the two is the location of the rash. While the location of the rash for individuals with mammary Paget disease is around the nipple and areolar skin, EPMD may occur in the vulva, perianal region, scrotum, penis, and axilla.[1003] EPMD most often occurs in women between age 50 to 60. About 25&nbsp;percent&nbsp;of extramammary Paget disease is associated with an underlying cancer. Treatment typically includes surgery.[1002] Prognosis varies depending on how early the disorder was diagnosed and treated as well as the association with an underlying cancer.

It&nbsp;is sometimes difficult to determine how much skin should be removed, particularly when lesions are spread throughout the anogenital region.
