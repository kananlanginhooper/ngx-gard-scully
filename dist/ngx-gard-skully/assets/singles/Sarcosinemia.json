Sarcosine (N-methylglycine) is enzymatically formed from dimethylglycine by dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.99.2) and converted to glycine by sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH; 604455; EC 1.5.99.1). Some reports have associated sarcosinemia with mental retardation and neurologic problems, but the disorder is most likely benign and unrelated to significant clinical problems (summary by Scott, 2001).","Disease__c":"Sarcosinemia","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C0268563","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
