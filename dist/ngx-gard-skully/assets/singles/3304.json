The cause of Lucey-Driscoll syndrome is thought to be due to compounds in the mother's and baby's blood that block the breakdown of bilirubin.[15274] In&nbsp;some&nbsp;babies, this condition may be the result of a genetic change in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/UGT1A1#\" target=\"_blank\">UGT1A1</a></em> gene,&nbsp;a risk factor for high levels of bilirubin.&nbsp; The diagnosis is made based on the symptoms.&nbsp; Treatment for Lucey-Driscoll syndrome includes phototherapy, placing the baby under a blue light to treat the high level of bilirubin in the blood.&nbsp; Sometimes, replacing the baby's blood with different blood (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002923.htm\" target=\"_blank\">exchange transfusion</a>) is necessary.[2695] If untreated, high levels of bilirubin can cause seizures, neurologic problems (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/19875.htm\" target=\"_blank\">kernicterus</a>) and even death.
