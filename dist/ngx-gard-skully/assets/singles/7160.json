The most common symptom of the syndrome is having missing or underdeveloped fingernails and toenails.

People with nail-patella syndrome are at an increased risk for developing high fluid pressure in the eye (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/glaucoma.html\" target=\"_blank\">glaucoma</a>) and kidney disease.[2530][2532][14541]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNail-patella syndrome is caused by genetic changes (pathogenic variants or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\">mutations</a>) in the&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LMX1B\"><em>LMX1B&nbsp;</em></a><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LMX1B\" target=\"_blank\"><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></em>gene</a>.

Treatment for nail-patella syndrome may include&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wcpt.org/what-is-physical-therapy\">physical therapy</a>&nbsp;or surgery for joint problems.

Almost all people with nail-patella syndrome have nails that are missing, underdeveloped, discolored, split, or ridged. The fingernails are more likely to be affected than the toenails. The thumbnails tend to be the most severely affected.[2530][2532][14541]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost people who have nail-patella syndrome have kneecaps that are small, absent, or irregularly shaped. This can cause problems such as frequent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001070.htm\">kneecap dislocation</a>&nbsp;or early-onset&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/arthritis.html\">arthritis</a>. One kneecap may be affected more than the other. Most people with the syndrome also have problems with one or both of their elbows because different parts of the elbow did not develop correctly. Some people are not able to fully extend their elbows or may have a hard time turning (rotating) the lower part of the arm when their arm is straight. The elbow may dislocate easily.[2530][2532][14541]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChanges in the pelvic bones called iliac horns can often be seen on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/xrays.html\">x-ray</a>&nbsp;and are found in 70% of people with nail-patella syndrome. Iliac horns are small pointy growths of bone (bony projections) that are not normally found on people's hip bones.&nbsp; Although these changes do not cause any health problems, iliac horns, if present, can be used to diagnose nail-patella syndrome.[2530][2532][14541]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther less common symptoms may include gastrointestinal problems such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/constipation.html\" target=\"_blank\">constipation</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/irritablebowelsyndrome.html\" target=\"_blank\">irritable bowel syndrome</a>. There may be nerve (neurological) problems affecting the hands and feet, such as reduced sensitivity to pain and temperature, numbness, tingling, or burning sensations.

Dental problems may include weak, crumbling teeth and thin dental enamel.[2532][14542]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople with nail-patella syndrome are at a higher risk to develop increased pressure in the eye (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/glaucoma.html\">glaucoma</a>).
