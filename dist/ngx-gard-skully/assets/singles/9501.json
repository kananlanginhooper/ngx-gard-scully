The episodes may last anywhere from a few seconds to hours and may occur spontaneously or be brought on by stress. The episodes usually first appear in infancy or childhood and tend to lessen in frequency with age. Hereditary geniospasm is believed to be inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant pattern</a>. Although the exact gene that causes the condition is unknown, it has been suggested that <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary.cfm?key=mutation\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in a gene on <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome=9\" target=\"_blank\">chromosome 9</a> may be responsible in some families.[1432][1433]","dateModified":"2013-06-05T10:14:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":6898,"questionText":"How is hereditary geniospasm inherited?","answerText":"Hereditary geniospasm is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=_blank>autosomal dominant</a> manner.[6021] This means that having only one mutated copy of the causative gene in each body cell is sufficient to cause signs and symptoms of the condition. When an individual with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the mutated copy of the gene and also be affected. Because there is a 50% chance for each child, it is possible for all of the children of an affected individual to be affected, or likewise, for all of the children to be unaffected.","dateModified":"2013-06-05T10:26:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[{"referenceId":6021,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Hereditary geniospasm","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet","date":"April 2009","url":"http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=EN&Expert=53372","dateAccessed":"2013-06-05T00:00:00"}]},{"questionId":2312,"questionText":"How&nbsp;might hereditary&nbsp;geniospasm be diagnosed?<br>","answerText":"Although we were unable to locate laboratories offering genetic testing for hereditary geniospasm, the condition can be diagnosed on the basis of a clinical evaluation performed by a health care professional&nbsp;such as a&nbsp;neurologist who specializes in movement disorders.
