CMT4 causes weakness, usually mostly distal (situated away from the center of the body) but sometimes involving proximal (near the center of the body) muscles. The most common symptoms are walking difficulties with steppage gait or an abnormally high arched foot (pes cavus) pes cavus. Hammer toes  and other skeletal deformities, such as an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine (scoliosis), are often observed. Some affected people have changes in sensations (such as the sense of touch or ability to perceive temperature changes). When CMT4 begins in infancy, it is characterized by low muscle tone. CMT4 patients may also develop other symptoms such as cataracts or deafness. Generally, cases of CMT4 present earlier and with more severe symptoms compared to CMT1 or CMT2.[15749][15750]&nbsp; Subtypes may have  different clinical features among them.
