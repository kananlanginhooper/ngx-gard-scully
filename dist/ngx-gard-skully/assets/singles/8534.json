To our knowledge, EPF has not been described specifically as an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000816.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autoimmune disease</a>&nbsp;or an allergic disorder. Several journal articles have described EPF more broadly as an \"inflammatory\" disorder.[12698][12699][12712] While some inflammatory disorders are also autoimmune disorders, others are not. When the cause of EPF is better understood, researchers may be able to better categorize the condition.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat being said, many researchers do suspect that the immune system plays a key role in developing the condition. A growing number of reports on EPF in people with weakened immune systems indicates the contribution of a disturbed immune system.[12699] It has been suggested that in both children and adults, EPF should be viewed as a possible cutaneous (skin) sign of immunosuppression. In contrast to autoimmunity (when the body mistakenly attacks healthy cells), immunosuppression makes the immune system less able to detect and destroy infections. However, EPF is also seen in people with normal immune status.[12700]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProposed triggers or causes of EPF have included:[12696]<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>an exaggerated reaction to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/introduction-to-fungal-infections/\" target=\"_blank\">dermatophytes (skin fungi) or saprophytic fungi</a>, in association with a disordered immune system.
