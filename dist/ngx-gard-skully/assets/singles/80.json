The severity, signs and symptoms of JBS may vary among affected individuals. Many symptoms are present at birth or early childhood. Characteristic features include intestinal malabsorption of fats and other nutrients due to abnormal development of the pancreas (pancreatic insufficiency); <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000991.htm\" target=\"_blank\">failure to thrive</a>, contributing to <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003271.htm\" target=\"_blank\">short stature</a>; abnormalities of permanent teeth; distinctive skull and facial features; and/or varying degrees of intellectual disability.

This gene provides instructions to the body to produce a protein that is important for the function of the <a href=\"http://pathology.jhu.edu/pc/BasicOverview1.php?area=ba\" target=\"_blank\">pancreas</a>. This protein is produced in specific cells in the pancreas called <a href=\"http://pathology.jhu.edu/pancreas/basicoverview3.php?area=ba\" target=\"_blank\">acinar cells</a>. Acinar cells are important because they help produce digestive enzymes which allow the pancreas to break down food and use the food products for growth (malabsorption). Because people with Johanson-Blizzard syndrome have a <em>UBR1</em> gene that is not functioning correctly, the acinar cells of the pancreas are destroyed and the pancreas cannot break down fats and other nutrients as well.[12856] This leads to many of the symptoms of JBS such as slow growth.</span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span>Johanson-Blizzard syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
