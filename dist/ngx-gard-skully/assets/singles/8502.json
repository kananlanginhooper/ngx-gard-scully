The condition may occur in one or both eyes. The degree of visual impairment varies widely depending on the severity and structures involved. Serous <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001027.htm\" target=\"_blank\">detachments of the retina</a> commonly occur in affected people, with a high risk for extensive retinal detachment. The coloboma may be associated with other features, such as a small eye (microphthalmia) with or without a cyst; small cornea (microcornea); or coloboma of other eye structures. Although the condition is present from birth, diagnosis may be delayed since the coloboma is inside the eye and not visible by simple inspection. Coloboma of the optic nerve may occur <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/sporadic/\" target=\"_blank\">sporadically</a>, may be due to a genetic <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a> and be inherited, or may occur as a feature of an underlying syndrome or other genetic condition. There is no treatment to correct an optic nerve coloboma, but low vision aids may be helpful for some people.[9875][9876][9880]","dateModified":"2015-10-28T10:36:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":9604,"questionText":"What causes coloboma of the optic nerve?","answerText":"Colobomas are due to incomplete development of the eye. During the second month of development in utero, a seam-like structure called the optic fissure closes up to form the structures of the eye.

When an underlying syndrome or genetic condition is present, the cause is assumed to be the same as that of the underlying condition. For example, when an optic nerve coloboma occurs as part of <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/renal-coloboma-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">renal coloboma syndrome</a>, it is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PAX2\" target=\"_blank\">PAX2</a></em> gene.[9880] Certain environmental factors affecting early development may also increase the risk for colobomas in general.[9877]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany genes involved in early eye development may be responsible for colobomas in general.
