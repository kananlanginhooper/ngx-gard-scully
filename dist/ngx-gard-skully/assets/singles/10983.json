Lesions generally are more prominent in the summer and less prominent in the winter. While it is usually benign (not cancerous), <a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/1091/squamous-cell-carcinoma/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">squamous cell carcinoma</a> or <a href=\"http://www.dermnetnz.org/lesions/bowen.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bowen&rsquo;s disease</a> may occasionally develop within patches.[8490] DSAP may be inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=12\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> matter or may occur sporadically (in people with no family history of DSAP).[8490] Some cases are caused by a change (mutation) in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MVK\" target=\"_blank\">MVK</a> or <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SART3\" target=\"_blank\">SART3</a> </em>genes.[8490][8491] There is no standard treatment for DSAP, and treatment is generally not effective long-term.[8488][8489] Sun avoidance may reduce the development of new patches.[8488] Treatments that have been beneficial in some people include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a698010.html\" target=\"_blank\">topical imiquimod  cream</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a605010.html\" target=\"_blank\">topical 5-fluorouracil</a>, and topical vitamin D analogs such as tacalcitol and <a href=\"https://www.aocd.org/page/Calcipotriene\" target=\"_blank\">calcipotriol</a>.
