The ataxia is usually associated with generalized weakness and/or inflammation of the brain (<a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Encephalopathy-Information-Page\" target=\"_blank\">encephalopathy</a>). The first episode most often happens between the ages of 6 months and 5 years.[14082][14177] Pregnancy and delivery may also  trigger episodes.[14178] Most people with CAPOS syndrome have one to three episodes during their lifetime.[14177] Other signs and symptoms during an episode may include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003298.htm\" target=\"_blank\">low muscle tone</a>, unusual eye movements (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003037.htm\" target=\"_blank\">nystagmus</a> or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001004.htm\" target=\"_blank\">strabismus</a>), problems with speech (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007470.htm\" target=\"_blank\">dysarthria</a>), difficulty swallowing (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/swallowingdisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">dysphagia</a>), reduced or absent <a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/en/kids/reflexes.html\" target=\"_blank\">reflexes</a>, and hearing loss. Some people may lose consciousness or go into a coma during an episode. Though many of the signs and symptoms of CAPOS syndrome get better as the fever and illness improve, some symptoms, including movement problems, may continue. Vision changes (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001622.htm\" target=\"_blank\">optic atrophy</a>) and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003291.htm\" target=\"_blank\">sensorineural hearing loss</a> tend to worsen over time, although the severity and rate of progression varies.[14082][14177][14178] Long-term management may include physical therapy, hearing and vision aids, and regular exams to check for changes in vision, hearing, and muscle coordination.[14082]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2017-12-19T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":12456,"questionText":"What causes CAPOS syndrome?","answerText":"CAPOS syndrome is caused by specific changes (mutations) in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ATP1A3\" target=\"_blank\">ATP1A3</a></em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ATP1A3\" target=\"_blank\"> gen</a>e.
