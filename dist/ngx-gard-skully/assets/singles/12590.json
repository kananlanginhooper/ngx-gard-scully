In general, people affected by these conditions are unable to move their eyes in certain directions and often have <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001004.htm\" target=\"_blank\">strabismus</a>&nbsp;and/or droopy eyelids (ptosis); however, the severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary significantly by subtype. CFEOM can be caused by changes (mutations) in several genes, including <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/KIF21A\" target=\"_blank\"><em>KIF21A</em></a>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TUBB3\" target=\"_blank\">TUBB3</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/PHOX2A\" target=\"_blank\">PHOX2A</a></em>, and <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/TUBB2B\" target=\"_blank\">TUBB2B</a>. In some cases, the underlying genetic cause is unknown. CFEOM can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner, depending on the subtype. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.[13265][13266][13267]","dateModified":"2017-03-25T15:36:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12583,"relatedDiseaseName":"Progressive muscular dystrophy","relation":"Parent","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":false}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
