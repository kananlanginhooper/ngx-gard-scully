CHARGE syndrome is characterized by the following: Unilateral or bilateral coloboma of the iris, retina-choroid, and/or disc with or without microphthalmos (80%-90% of individuals). Unilateral or bilateral choanal atresia or stenosis (50%-60%). Cranial nerve dysfunction resulting in hyposmia or anosmia, unilateral or bilateral facial palsy (40%), impaired hearing, and/or swallowing problems (70%-90%). Abnormal outer ears, ossicular malformations, Mondini defect of the cochlea and absent or hypoplastic semicircular canals (>90%). Cryptorchidism in males and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in both males and females. Developmental delay. Cardiovascular malformations (75%-85%). Growth deficiency (70%-80%). Orofacial clefts (15%-20%). Tracheoesophageal fistula (15%-20%). Neonates with CHARGE syndrome often have multiple life-threatening medical conditions. Feeding difficulties are a major cause of morbidity in all age groups.","Disease__c":"CHARGE syndrome","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C0265354","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
