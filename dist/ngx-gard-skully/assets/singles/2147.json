This disorder usually presents at birth or during infancy and results in&nbsp;widespread blisters over the body's surface.[2378][15276][15278] Though it is not a common feature of this type, scarring may occur.&nbsp;There may also be mild involvement of mucous membranes,&nbsp;fingernails and toenails, and localized thickening of the skin on the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands that increases&nbsp;with age.[15278] There are two major subtypes of this condition and 17 minor subtypes. The four most common types of epidermolysis bullosa simplex are EBS localized, EBS generalized intermediate, EBS with mottled pigmentation and EBS generalized severe.
