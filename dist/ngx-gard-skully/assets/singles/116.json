There are three types of Schindler disease. <strong>Schindler disease type 1</strong>, also called the infantile type, is the most severe form. Babies with this condition appear healthy a birth, but by the age of 8 to 15 months they stop developing new skills and begin losing skills they had already acquired. As the condition progresses, affected individuals develop blindness and seizures, and eventually lose awareness of their surroundings and become unresponsive. People with this form of the condition usually don't survive past early childhood. Schindler disease type 1 is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/NAGA\" target=\"_blank\">NAGA</a></em> gene. The condition follows an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>&nbsp;pattern of inheritance.[8891]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2015-05-13T13:57:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":8761,"questionText":"What causes Schindler disease type 1?","answerText":"Schindler disease type 1 is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/NAGA\" target=\"_blank\">NAGA</a></em> gene.
