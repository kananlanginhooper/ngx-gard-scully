In the spine, the vertebrae are misshapen and fused.

The ribs may be fused together or missing. These bone malformations lead to short, rigid necks and short midsections. Infants with spondylocostal dysostosis have small, narrow chests that cannot fully expand. This can lead to life-threatening breathing problems. Males with this condition are at an increased risk for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/inguinal-hernia/Pages/facts.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">inguinal hernia</a>, where the diaphragm is pushed down, causing the abdomen to bulge out.
