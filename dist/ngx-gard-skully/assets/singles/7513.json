These enzymes are part of a group of three enzymes called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex converts a chemical called pyruvate into another chemical called acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). Acetyl-CoA is an important compound that helps the body make energy through a cycle known as the citric acid cycle. This cycle allows the body to get energy from proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.[2851] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is not working properly, pyruvate can&rsquo;t be converted to acetyl-CoA. This causes pyruvate to build up in cells. The pyruvate instead is turned into lactic acid, which is toxic to the body in large amounts and causes <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000391.htm\">lactic acidosis</a>. When pyruvate isn&rsquo;t converted into acetyl-CoA, the body also can&rsquo;t go through the citric acid cycle. Therefore, enough energy is not made for the body to function properly. The brain is a part of the body that requires a lot of energy, so the symptoms that are first seen when energy is lacking often affect the brain. The signs and symptoms of PDC deficiency are variable because the amount of enzyme that is available to create energy varies in different people with the disease.[2851]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPDC deficiency is caused by genetic changes (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/mutationsanddisorders/genemutation\">mutations</a> or pathogenic variants) in any of the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/gene\">genes</a> that provide instructions for the body to make the enzymes of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.

Males therefore have one copy of the <em>PDHA1 </em>gene and females have two copies. Males or females with a change in one copy of the <em>PDHA1 </em>gene can have signs or symptoms of PDC deficiency. However, because females have another copy of the <em>PDHA1</em> gene<em>&nbsp;</em>that is producing the enzyme of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, some females may have less severe symptoms of the disease.[2851]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn some cases, people who have a pathogenic variant in <em>PDHA1 </em>are the first people in the family with the genetic change.[14376] This is because many people with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency pass away before they have children. Genetic changes that are new in a person are called <em>de novo</em>. In some cases, people who have a pathogenic variant in <em>PDHA1 </em>inherited the genetic change from their mother. The mother may have less severe symptoms of PDC deficiency or no symptoms at all. In these situations, each future child of that woman will have a 50% chance to inherit the pathogenic variant that causes the disease.[14374]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe other genes that cause PDC deficiency are not located on the sex chromosomes, so they are called autosomal genes.[2851][14375] We inherit one copy of every autosomal gene from our mother and the other from our father. People with changes in both copies of the autosomal genes that cause PDC deficiency have symptoms of the disease. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance.
