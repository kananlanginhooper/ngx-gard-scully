Signs and symptoms typically appear by late childhood or adolescence.[9088][14669] Signs and symptoms may include deformity, contracture, chronic pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. In some cases, the overlying skin and soft tissue may show thickening, shininess, reddening or darkening, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/9513/linear-scleroderma\" target=\"_blank\">linear scleroderma</a>, and/or swelling. The condition typically affects the <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002249.htm\" target=\"_blank\">long bones</a>, and the legs are affected more often than the arms. Sometimes the small bones of the hand or foot are affected, and rarely, bones of the skull or trunk are affected. The condition is sometimes associated with other bone or connective tissue abnormalities.[14669] The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical and radiological features, which are used to distinguish melorheostosis from other bone disorders.[14670]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIsolated melorheostosis (with no other associated disorders) is typically sporadic, occurring in people with no family history of the condition.[14671] Around half of cases of&nbsp;isolated melorheostosis are due to acquired, somatic mutations in the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MAP2K1\" target=\"_blank\">MAP2K1</a>&nbsp;</em>gene; these mutations are not inherited from a parent and occur randomly during a person's lifetime.[14671][14672] In the remainder of cases, the cause is not yet known. Somatic mutations in other, unidentified genes may also cause the disorder.[14672] Some people with melorheostosis associated with other bone disorders (specifically <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/4158/osteopoikilosis\" target=\"_blank\">osteopoikilosis</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/buschke-ollendorff-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Buschke&ndash;Ollendorff syndrome</a>) have heritable mutations in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LEMD3\" target=\"_blank\">LEMD3</a></em> gene, but mutations in this gene are not thought to be responsible for isolated&nbsp;melorheostosis.[14670][14671]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nManagement depends on the severity and symptoms in each person and aims to relieve pain, correct deformity, and restore movement.[14673] Management options may include medications, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and/or orthopedic surgery.[14669][14670]&nbsp;Melorheostosis is not life-threatening, but chronic pain can greatly impact quality of life.[14673]","dateModified":"2018-05-29T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":8960,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of melorheostosis?","answerText":"<span dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<div style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\">Signs and symptoms of melorheostosis vary.

Rarely it affects the spinal column, pelvis, skull, ribs, or other bones. It most often affects just one area of the body, but it can affect multiple areas.[9088][14669][14672]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost people with melorheostosis have pain, which can be chronic (long-lasting) and may range from from dull to sharp and penetrating. Hardening of the skin and tissues around the affected bone can cause stiffness, and the involved skin may be tense, shiny, reddish, swollen, or with prominent veins.[9088][14672] When melorheostosis involves a joint, it may result in a joint contracture (i.e., limited joint movement). Melorheostosis can also affect growth; for example, the affected limb can be shorter than the unaffected limb.[9088] If melorheostosis is associated with another bone disorder or syndrome, additional signs and symptoms may be present.</div>\r\n</span>","dateModified":"2018-05-31T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":9088,"authors":"Gagliardi GG, Mahan KT","articleTitle":"Melorheostosis: a literature review and case report with surgical considerations","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Foot Ankle Surg","date":"2010 Jan-Feb","volume":"49(1)","pages":"80-5","url":"","dateAccessed":"2015-06-16T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9091,"authors":"Roger D, Bonnetblanc JM, Leroux-Robert C","articleTitle":"Melorheostosis with associated minimal change nephrotic syndrome, mesenteric fibromatosis and capillary haemangiomas","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Dermatology","date":"1994","volume":"188","pages":"166-168","url":"","dateAccessed":"2015-06-17T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14669,"authors":"Smith GC, Pingree MJ, Freeman LA, et al","articleTitle":"Melorheostosis: A Retrospective Clinical Analysis of 24 Patients at the Mayo Clinic","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"PM R","date":"March, 2017","volume":"9(3)","pages":"283-288","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27485676","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14672,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Melorheostosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"May, 2018","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/melorheostosis","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":8962,"questionText":"How might melorheostosis be treated?","answerText":"There is no standard treatment for melorheostosis, and options are individualized based on the specific symptoms and severity in each person.
