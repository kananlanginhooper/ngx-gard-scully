In early stages of the condition, there may be no concerning signs or symptoms. As the tumor gets larger, affected children may experience a painful, abdominal lump; swelling of the abdomen; unexplained weight loss; loss of appetite; and/or nausea and vomiting. The exact underlying cause of hepatoblastoma is poorly understood. Risk factors for the tumor include prematurity with a very low birth weight, early exposure to hepatitis B infection, biliary atresia, and several different genetic conditions (i.e. <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/3343/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/resources/1\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/6408/familial-adenomatous-polyposis/resources/1\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">familial adenomatous polyposis</a>, <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/aicardi-syndrome\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">Aicardi syndrome</a>, <a href=\"http://www.agsdus.org/html/glycogenandgsds.html\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">Glycogen storage disease</a>, and <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/7649/simpson-golabi-behmel-syndrome/resources/1\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome</a>).
