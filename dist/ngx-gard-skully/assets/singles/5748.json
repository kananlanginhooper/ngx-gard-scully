People with SCID due to ADA deficiency are unable to fight off most types of infections, including bacterial, viral and fungal infections. Most people with ADA deficiency develop symptoms before 6 months of age. The earliest symptoms of ADA deficiency include pneumonia, chronic diarrhea, widespread skin rashes, slowed growth, and/or developmental delay. Some people with ADA deficiency will develop symptoms later in life. The symptoms in the late-onset form are typically milder than in the form that occurs in infancy. ADA deficiency is caused by mutations in the <em>ADA</em> gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.[8058][8059] Diagnosis may be suspected by newborn screening or symptoms and confirmed by blood and genetic test results.&nbsp; Currently, the most effective treatment is transplantation of blood-forming stem cells from the bone marrow of a healthy brother or sister of the person with ADA deficiency.[8059][15084]","dateModified":"2018-11-28T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":8104,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of adenosine deaminase deficiency?","answerText":"The symptoms of adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA deficiency) usually begin before 6 months of age.[8058][8059] Babies with ADA deficiency usually develop serious lung infections and chronic diarrhea.

Gene therapy involves replacing a copy of the non-working <em>ADA</em> gene with a working copy, so that a person can make the ADA enzyme on his or her own. Gene therapy for SCID due to ADA deficiency has been approved in Europe [15091], but is still considered experimental in the US.<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2018-11-28T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":8064,"authors":"Rubinstein A","articleTitle":"Adenosine deaminase deficiency: Treatment","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"August 2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15084,"authors":"Kohn DB, Hershfield MS, Puck JM, Aiuti A et al","articleTitle":"Consensus approach for the management of severe combined immune deficiency caused by adenosine deaminase deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Allergy Clin Immunol","date":"Sept 2018","volume":"","pages":"available on-line","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30194989","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15090,"authors":"Scott O, Kim VH-D, Reid B, Pham-Huy A, Atkinson A, Aiuti A, Grunebaum E","articleTitle":"Long-term outcome of Adenosine deaminase-deficient patients ‚Äì a single-center experience","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Clin Immunol","date":"2017","volume":"37","pages":"582-591","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28748310","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15091,"authors":"Aiuti A, Roncarolo MG, Naldini L","articleTitle":"Gene therapy for ADA-SCID, the first marketing approval of an ex vivo gene therapy in Europe: paving the road for the next generation of advanced therapy medicinal products","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"EMBO Molecular Med","date":"2017","volume":"9(6)","pages":"737-740","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5452047","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":13064,"questionText":"How many people have adenosine deaminase deficiency?&nbsp;","answerText":"Adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA deficiency) affects about 1 in 200,000 &ndash; 1 in 1,000,000 people worldwide.[8059] About 15% of all cases of severe combined immune deficiency are caused by ADA deficiency.[8058]","dateModified":"2018-11-28T13:55:00","resourceClassificationName":"Statistics","references":[{"referenceId":8058,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Adenosine deaminase deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"July 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/adenosine-deaminase-deficiency","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8059,"authors":"Hershfield M","articleTitle":"Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"Mar 2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1483","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":8110,"questionText":"What is the long-term outlook for people with adenosine deaminase deficiency?","answerText":"The long-term outlook (prognosis) for people with adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA deficiency) varies depending on the severity of the condition, the timing of the diagnosis, and the response to treatment.[8064][15090] Newborn screening for SCID has made it possible for more babies to get diagnosed and treated earlier.[8059] This may change long-term outcomes.&nbsp; <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor babies diagnosed early and treated with a bone marrow transplant/stem cell transplant, the long-term outlook is generally good.
