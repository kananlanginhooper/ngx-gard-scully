Affected people usually develop moderate visual loss and color vision defects. The severity varies and visual acuity can range from normal to legal blindness. About 20% of people with DOA have non-ocular features, such as <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003291.htm\" target=\"_blank\">sensorineural hearing loss</a>; <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/myopathy/myopathy.htm\" target=\"_blank\">myopathy</a>; <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/peripheralneuropathy/peripheralneuropathy.htm\" target=\"_blank\">peripheral neuropathy</a>; multiple sclerosis-like illness; and spastic paraplegia (impaired function of the legs).[7017] These cases may be referred to as 'DOA plus.'[7016] DOA is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner and may be caused by a <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a> in any of several genes, some of which have not been identified.
