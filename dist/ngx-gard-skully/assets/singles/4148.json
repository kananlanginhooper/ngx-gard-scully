The severity of the condition and the associated symptoms vary significantly from person to person, even within a single family. Features of the condition are generally present at birth and may include&nbsp;skeletal abnormalities (particularly at the ends of long bones), sclerosis (hardening) of the <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/craniofacialabnormalities.html\" target=\"_blank\">craniofacial</a> bones, macrocephaly (unusually large head size), and characteristic facial features. Some affected people may also have developmental delay, hearing loss, heart defects and/or ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of the muscles surrounding the eyes). Osteopathia striata cranial sclerosis is caused by changes (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>) in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/AMER1\" target=\"_blank\">WTX</a></em> gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.genetics.edu.au/Publications-and-Resources/Genetics-Fact-Sheets/FactSheet10A\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked dominant</a> manner.
