The size of the duplication can range from a tiny piece of the chromosome arm, to the entire arm. Signs and symptoms that can be present in a person with a 10p duplication may include delay of development, motor skills, or growth; short stature; low muscle tone (hypotonia); abnormalities of the foot (such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001228.htm\" target=\"_blank\">clubfoot</a>); cleft lip and/or cleft palate; and distinctive facial features. Other signs and symptoms may include seizures, a heart defect, or other birth defects.[14663]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome 10p duplications are not inherited and occur sporadically (randomly) when egg or sperm cells form, or shortly after the egg and sperm join together. In other cases, the duplication occurs because a parent has a chromosome rearrangement such as a balanced translocation or a pericentric inversion (neither of which usually  causes health problems). A chromosome test of both parents can help determine whether the duplication was inherited, and whether future children have an increased chance to have a chromosome abnormality.[14663] Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis page is meant to provide general information about 10p duplications.
