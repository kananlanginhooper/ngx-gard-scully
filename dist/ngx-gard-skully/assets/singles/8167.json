Acquired PPK may arise due to changes in a person's health or environment.[3375]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInherited forms of PPK are caused by genetic mutations that result in abnormalities of keratin (a skin protein). These forms of PPK may be present in more than one family member. Mutations in several genes can cause an inherited form of PPK. Depending on the gene involved, inheritance can be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive.[3374][3375]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAutosomal dominant inheritance means that having a mutation in only one copy of the responsible&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a>&nbsp;in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition.&nbsp;In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutated gene from an affected parent. In other cases, the mutation occurs for the first time in a person with no family history of the condition. This is called a&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=denovomutation\" target=\"_blank\">de novo</a></em>&nbsp;mutation.&nbsp;When a person with a mutation that causes an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit that mutation. For this reason, it is not uncommon for an autosomal dominant condition to be present in more than one generation in a family.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAutosomal recessive inheritance&nbsp;means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation&nbsp;in both copies of the responsible gene&nbsp;in each cell. Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/?id=23\" target=\"_blank\">carrier</a>. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>25% chance to be affected</li>\r\n    <li>50% chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent</li>\r\n    <li>25% chance to be unaffected&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;not a carrier</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A person with an autosomal recessive condition can have an affected child only if the child's other parent is at least a carrier of the same condition. In most cases, autosomal recessive conditions affect only one generation in a family, such as siblings.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople with personal questions regarding whether PPK  is inherited, or how it may be inherited, are encouraged to speak with a genetic counselor or other genetics professional.

Acquired PPK usually occurs later in life and may be due to many causes, such as drugs, malnutrition, chemicals, systemic disease, cancer, and infection.[12849]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe family history may be helpful in identifying hereditary PPK and establishing the inheritance pattern.[12850] Lack of a family history is not necessarily evidence of acquired PPK. Autosomal recessive PPK can appear sporadically from unaffected parent carriers, and autosomal dominant PPK can also occur sporadically due to a new mutation in an affected person (a&nbsp;<em>de novo</em> mutation).[12849]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHistopathology of a biopsy from affected skin should be part of the diagnostic workup. This may show more specific features characteristic of a subtype of PPK. Distinguishing between epidermolytic and nonepidermolytic forms of PPK is helpful for treatment options, as epidermolytic forms tend to worsen on systemic retinoids. Histopathology is also needed to rule out other conditions with overlapping features.[12850]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGenetic testing allows for a precise diagnosis as well as counseling with regard to the inheritance pattern and risk of recurrence.[12850] The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/all/conditions/?term=%22Palmoplantar%20keratoderma%22[DISNAME]\" target=\"_blank\">Genetic Testing Registry</a> (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for each hereditary type of PPK.
