Symptoms of the condition include having small eyes, vision loss, missing teeth, frequent cavities, and bony growths in the fingers. The condition is caused by a mutation in <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GJA1\" target=\"_blank\">GJA1</a></em> and is most typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.[2945] Oculodentodigital dysplasia can be diagnosed by a clinical examination and confirmed with genetic testing. Management is based on treating the specific symptoms that each affected person exhibits. Early diagnosis can help ensure that the best treatment is available and that steps can be taken to prevent more symptoms from developing.[2947][13085]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2017-02-19T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":4002,"questionText":"What are the symptoms of oculodentodigital dysplasia?","answerText":"<span>The most common features of oculodentodigital dysplasia affect the eyes, teeth, and fingers and toes.

These individuals may also have </span><span>glaucoma,</span><span> or one or both eyes may turn inwards (</span><span>strabismus</span><span>). These eye problems may cause affected individuals to have vision loss. Tooth abnormalities include having small or missing teeth and weak enamel leading to multiple cavities. Finger and toe abnormalities may include having bony growths in the hands or webbing of the skin (</span><span>syndactyly</span><span>) between the fourth and fifth fingers or toes.[2945][2946]</span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span>People with oculodentodigital dysplasia may also have features that affect other body parts. These features may include having a thin nose, sparse hair growth (<a href=\"http://www.americanhairloss.org/types_of_hair_loss/congenital_hypotrichosis.asp\">hypotrichosis</a>), brittle nails, curved fingers, small head size (</span><span>microcephaly</span><span>), and an opening in the roof of the mouth (</span><span>cleft palate</span><span>). Some individuals may also experience neurological problems that can cause a lack of bladder or bowel control (incontinence), difficulty coordinating movements (</span><span>ataxia</span><span>), abnormal muscle stiffness (</span><span>spasticity</span><span>), hearing loss, and impaired speech (</span><span>dysarthria</span><span>).[13086] </span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span>A few people with oculodentodigital dysplasia have a skin condition called </span><a href=\"http://www.pcds.org.uk/clinical-guidance/keratoderma\"><span>palmoplantar keratoderma</span></a><span>.

Gap junctions allow for communication between cells of the body. When there is a mutation in <em>GJA1</em>, the body does not form gap junctions correctly, and the communication between cells does not work well.

This means that a parent with a change in the <em>GJA1</em> gene passes this change on to his or her child. We inherit one copy of every gene from our mother, and the other copy from our father.

This could occur for one of two reasons. First, one of the parents of the affected individual may have the changed gene, but does not show any symptoms of the condition. This is a situation called </span><span>reduced penetrance</span><span>, which occurs when a mutated gene does not cause symptoms in every individual who has the gene. Another reason that a person affected by oculodentodigital dysplasia might be the only person in his or her family to be affected by the condition is because it might be occurring </span><a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/genetics-dictionary?cdrid=460142\"><em>de novo</em></a><span> in that individual.

Possible treatments for conditions of the eye include wearing a patch over an eye that has correctly working muscles in order to strengthen the muscles of the other eye.
