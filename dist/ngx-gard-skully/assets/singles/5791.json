This condition causes teeth to be unusually small, discolored, pitted or grooved, and prone to rapid wear and breakage with early tooth decay and loss.&nbsp;These dental problems, which vary among affected individuals, can affect both primary (baby) teeth and permanent teeth. People with this disease my also have problems involving the tissues surrounding teeth (periodontal tissues) such as gums, cementum, ligaments, and alveolar bones in which the tooth root rests. Teeth are also sensitive to either hot or cold exposures, and sometimes both. Severe and continuous pain due to exposed dentin resulting from the enamel defect is present in some cases.[1144][1892][14715]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are&nbsp;4 main types of AI that are classified based on the symptoms, X-rays appearance and&nbsp; type of enamel defect. The main types are: hypoplastic (type I); hypomaturation (type II); hypocalcified (type III); and hypomaturation/hypoplasia/taurodontism (type IV). These 4 types are divided further into <a href=\"https://www.omim.org/phenotypicSeries/PS104500\" target=\"_blank\">17 or 18 subtypes</a>, which are distinguished by their specific genetic cause and by their pattern of inheritance.[1892][14715] AI can be inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> or <a href=\"http://www.genetics.com.au/factsheet/fs10.asp\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked recessive</a> pattern.[1144] Treatment may include dentures that cap the teeth (full crown restorations), orthodontic treatment, special toothpaste for the tooth sensitivity, and good oral hygiene.[14715]","dateModified":"2018-06-11T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":9408,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of amelogenesis imperfecta?","answerText":"In general, both the primary and permanent teeth are affected.

The enamel in the hypomaturation and hypocalcification types is not mineralized and is thus described as hypomineralized.[1892]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTraditionally, the diagnosis and classification of amelogenesis imperfecta is based on the clinical presentation and the mode of inheritance.

Mutations in any of these genes alter the structure of these proteins or prevent the genes from making any protein at all. As a result, tooth enamel is abnormally thin or soft and may have a yellow or brown color.
