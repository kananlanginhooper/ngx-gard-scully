It is typically  managed through dietary restrictions, including a low-fat diet and supplementation of a specific type of fat more easily absorbed by individuals with this condition (medium chain triglycerides).

Periodic intravenous (IV) infusion of a protein called albumin may be useful in treating swelling of the lower limbs and/or buildup of excess bodily fluids.
