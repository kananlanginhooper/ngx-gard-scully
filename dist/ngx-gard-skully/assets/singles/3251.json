Could you please send me some information?","caseQuestions":[{"questionId":3408,"questionText":"What is limb-body wall complex (LBWC)?","answerText":"<strong>Limb-body wall complex</strong> (LBWC) is a condition characterized by multiple, severe congenital abnormalities in a fetus. It typically results in openings in the anterior body wall (chest and belly) and defects of the limbs (arms and legs). Other features of LBWC may include <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001051.htm\" target=\"_blank\">facial clefts</a>; a short or missing umbilical cord; <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001241.htm\" target=\"_blank\">scoliosis</a>; <a href=\"http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/ntds/conditioninfo/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">neural tube defects</a>; and&nbsp;abnormalities of the <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/genitourinary\" target=\"_blank\">urogenital</a>  organs (i.e. kidney, bladder, and/or genitals). The exact cause of LBWC is unclear. Unfortunately, there is no cure for LBWC and it is considered to be incompatible with life (fatal).[8593][8594][8595] The majority of affected pregnancies end in <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/fetal_death.htm\" target=\"_blank\">fetal demise</a>.[11727]","dateModified":"2016-06-21T00:00:00","references":[{"referenceId":8593,"authors":"Courtney D Stephenson, DO; Charles J Lockwood, MD, MHCM; Andrew P MacKenzie, MD","articleTitle":"Body stalk anomaly and cloacal exstrophy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UptoDate","date":"November 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"","dateAccessed":"2015-04-02T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8594,"authors":"Keerthi Kocherla, Vasantha Kumari, and Prasada Rao Kocherla","articleTitle":"Prenatal diagnosis of body stalk complex: A rare entity and review of literature","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Indian J Radiol Imaging","date":"Jan-Mar 2015","volume":"25(1)","pages":"67-70","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4329692/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8595,"authors":"Panduranga Chikkannaiah, Hema Dhumale, Ranjit Kangle, and Rosini Shekar","articleTitle":"Limb Body Wall Complex: A Rare Anomaly","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Lab Physicians","date":"Jan-Jun 2013","volume":"5(1)","pages":"65-67","url":"http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.nihlibrary.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3758712/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11727,"authors":"Bhat A, Ilyas M, Dev G","articleTitle":"Prenatal sonographic diagnosis of limb-body wall complex: case series of a rare congenital anomaly","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Radiol Case Rep","date":"March 15, 2016","volume":"11(2)","pages":"116-120","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":3409,"questionText":"What causes limb-body wall complex?","answerText":"The exact underlying cause of limb-body wall complex (LBWC) is currently unknown. However, scientist have proposed the following three theories as possible explanations for the condition:[8593][8594]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(1) <em><a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001579.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Amniotic bands</a></em>&nbsp;- LBWC occurs when the amniotic sac (the fluid-filled sac that surrounds the baby) breaks early, leading to the development of amniotic bands. These bands can cause <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000006.htm\" target=\"_blank\">amputations</a> and constrictions in the developing baby. The timing of this event may explain the varying severity from case to case.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(2) <em>Vascular \"disruption\" </em>- LBWC is caused by a disruption of blood flow in the developing baby. This is a common explanation for certain types of <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/birthdefects.html\" target=\"_blank\">birth defects</a>, especially limb abnormalities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n(3) <em>Abnormal embryonic folding </em>- Early in development, the embryo folds to ensure the proper development and placement of different body parts and organs. If this event doesn't take place or if the embryo folds abnormally, it could lead to the various signs and symptoms associated with LBWC.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe majority of cases are considered to be sporadic, regardless of underlying cause and recurrence risk is considered to be low; however, there is at least one case reported in the medical literature of a woman having two different pregnancies with LBWC.[10891]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRecently, some authors have proposed a potential genetic origin of LBWC involving mutations in genes related to laterality (left or right side of the body) and caudal development (the lower half of the body). More genetic studies on infants with LBWC are needed to prove this connection.[10892]<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2016-03-10T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":8593,"authors":"Courtney D Stephenson, DO; Charles J Lockwood, MD, MHCM; Andrew P MacKenzie, MD","articleTitle":"Body stalk anomaly and cloacal exstrophy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UptoDate","date":"November 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"","dateAccessed":"2015-04-02T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":8594,"authors":"Keerthi Kocherla, Vasantha Kumari, and Prasada Rao Kocherla","articleTitle":"Prenatal diagnosis of body stalk complex: A rare entity and review of literature","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Indian J Radiol Imaging","date":"Jan-Mar 2015","volume":"25(1)","pages":"67-70","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4329692/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":10891,"authors":"B.
