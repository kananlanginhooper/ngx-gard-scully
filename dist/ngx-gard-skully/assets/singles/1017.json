People with this condition have bones that break easily, often from little or no trauma, however, severity varies among affected people. Multiple fractures are common, and in severe cases, can even occur before birth. Milder cases may involve only a few fractures over a person's lifetime. People with OI also have dental problems (<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/6258/dentinogenesis-imperfecta/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">dentinogenesis imperfecta</a>) and hearing loss in adulthood.
