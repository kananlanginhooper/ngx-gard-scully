The tissue in this accessory lung bud migrates with the developing lung, but does not communicate with it. It receives its blood supply from vessels that connect to the aorta or one of its side branches.[12033][12039] The arterial supply is derived in most cases from the thoracic aorta (75%) or the abdominal aorta (20%). In some cases (15%), two different arteries supply the blood.[12039] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf the accessory lung bud develops early in embryonic development, the pulmonary sequestration occurs among the normal lung tissue, where it is encased within the pleural sac. This results in intralobular pulmonary sequestration. Venous drainage of intralobular pulmonary sequestration is usually through the pulmonary circulation. If the accessory lung bud develops later, extralobular pulmonary sequestration results. This type of pulmonary sequestration is separated from the normal lung tissue by its own visceral pleura and can occur above, within, or below the diaphragm. Venous drainage is usually through the systemic circulation.[12033][12039]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2016-08-14T15:58:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":12033,"authors":"Schnapf BM","articleTitle":"Pediatric Pulmonary Sequestration","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"May 1, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1005815-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12039,"authors":"Mazzarella G, Iadevaia C, Guerra G, Rocca A, Corcione N, Rossi G, Amore D, Brunese L, Bianco A","articleTitle":"Intralobar pulmonary sequestration in an adult female patient mimicking asthma: a case report.","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Int J Surg","date":"2014","volume":"12 Suppl 2","pages":"S73-7","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25159547","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":10976,"questionText":"Is pulmonary sequestration inherited?","answerText":"While the vast majority of pulmonary sequestration cases occur in isolation (without any family history), rare familial cases have been reported.[2220][12040][12041] Therefore, a genetic component  cannot be ruled out.&nbsp;","dateModified":"2016-08-14T16:12:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[{"referenceId":2220,"authors":"Mason","articleTitle":"","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Murray & Nadel's Textbook of Respiratory Medicine, 4th ed.","date":"2005","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":"Saunders"},{"referenceId":12040,"authors":"Abuhamad AZ, Bass T, Katz ME, Heyl PS.","articleTitle":"Familial recurrence of pulmonary sequestration.","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Obstet Gynecol","date":"1996 May","volume":"87(5 Pt. 2)","pages":"843-5","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8677110","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":12041,"authors":"Becker J, Hernandez A, Dipietro M, Coran AG","articleTitle":"Identical twins concordant for pulmonary sequestration communicating with the esophagus and discordant for the VACTERL association.","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Pediatr Surg Int","date":"2005 Jul","volume":"21(7)","pages":"541-6","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15937657","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":3234,"questionText":"How might intralobular pulmonary sequestration be treated?","answerText":"Due to&nbsp;the risk for infection and bleeding, intralobar pulmonary sequestrations are usually removed, either by segmentectomy (removal of part of the lung) or lobectomy (removal of the full lobe).
