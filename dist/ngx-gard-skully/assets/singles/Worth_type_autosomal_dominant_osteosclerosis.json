The skeleton is normal in childhood. Facial metamorphoses occur in adolescence, as the forehead flattens, the mandible becomes elongated, and the gonial angle decreases. An enlarging osseous prominence (torus palatinus) develops in the hard palate, which may lead to malocclusion or loss of teeth (summary by Van Wesenbeeck et al., 2003).","Disease__c":"Worth type autosomal dominant osteosclerosis","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C0432273","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
