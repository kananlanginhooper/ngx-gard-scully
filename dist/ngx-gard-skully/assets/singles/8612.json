With more severe disease, a person may have a loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, confusion or impaired thinking and memory, and increased thirst and urination. Patients may have thinning of the bones without symptoms, but with risk of fractures.[5137] There are two main types of hyperparathyroidism: <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000384.htm\" target=_blank>primary hyperparathyroidism</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000318.htm\" target=_blank>secondary hyperparathyroidism</a>.[5136] Surgery to remove the&nbsp;parathyroid gland(s) is the main treatment for the disorder.
