It causes incomplete development of Leydig cells, which are cells in the testicles (testes) that secrete male sex hormones (androgens). These hormones are needed for normal male sexual development as reproductive organs are forming (before birth), as well as during puberty. A genetic male with LCH has typical male chromosomes (<a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/howmanychromosomes\" target=\"_blank\">46, XY</a>), but due to low androgen levels, may have a range of genital differences.[12137][12138][12139]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a genetic male with LCH, the external genitalia may not look clearly male or female (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003269.htm\" target=\"_blank\">ambiguous genitalia</a>). Specific features of LCH may include a small penis (micropenis), a urethra opening (hole) on the underside of the penis rather than at the tip (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001286.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hypospadias</a>), and a scrotum that is divided into two halves (bifid scrotum). A person with a severe form of LCH may have only&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.uofmhealth.org/node/653298\" target=\"_blank\">female external genitalia</a>, and small undescended testes (located in the pelvis, abdomen, or groin).[12137][12139] Males with severe LCH may not develop secondary sex characteristics during puberty, such as increased body hair, facial hair, and a deeper voice.[12138]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLCH is caused by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LHCGR\" target=\"_blank\">LHCGR</a></em>&nbsp;gene and inheritance is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>.[12137][12138] There is no standard treatment for LCH.

Genetic females with these mutations have normal female external genitalia and normal female development during puberty, but may have amenorrhea (absent periods) and infertility.[14332]","dateModified":"2018-02-12T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
