Dysfibrinogenemias may be inherited (congenital) or acquired. Congenital dysfibrinogenemia is rare. About 40% of people with this form have no symptoms. About 50% have a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bleedingdisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">bleeding disorder</a>, and the remaining 10% have either a thrombotic disorder (excessive clotting) or both bleeding and thrombotic disorders.[1844] Congenital dysfibrinogenemias may be caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FGA\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FGA</em></a>, <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FGB\" target=\"_blank\">FGB</a></em> or <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FGG\" target=\"_blank\">FGG</a></em> genes.[11855] Inheritance is most often&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a>  or <a href=\"http://c.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/codominant\" target=\"_blank\">codominant</a>, but can also be&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>.[1844] Whether a person has no symptoms, a bleeding tendency, or an increased risk of thrombosis depends on the effect of their specific mutation(s).[11857] Most people with dysfibrinogenemia have no symptoms and don't need treatment. For the remainder, treatment is individualized and depends on the symptoms and severity in each person.[11855]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAcquired dysfibrinogenemia is more common than the congenital form and is associated with liver disease such as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/cirrhosis.html\" target=\"_blank\">cirrhosis</a>, liver tumors, or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/hepatitis.html\" target=\"_blank\">hepatitis</a>.[11855]","dateModified":"2016-07-14T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":2825,"questionText":"How many people have dysfibrinogenemia?","answerText":"Congenital dysfibrinogenemia is considered rare, but the true incidence is unknown since many forms don't cause signs or symptoms.[11855] In the literature, only&nbsp;200-300 families have been reported.[1844]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nApproximately 50% of patients with severe liver disease have bleeding tendencies secondary to abnormal fibrinogen (acquired dysfibrinogenemia).[1844]","dateModified":"2016-07-14T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Statistics","references":[{"referenceId":1844,"authors":"Russell Burgess","articleTitle":"Dysfibrinogenemia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"October 21, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/199723-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":11855,"authors":"Caroline Bérubé","articleTitle":"Disorders of fibrinogen","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"June, 2016","volume":"","pages":"","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"Waltham, MA","publisher":"UpToDate"}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[{"caseId":57478,"abbreviatedInquiry":"Can dysfibrinogenemia go away as you get older?
