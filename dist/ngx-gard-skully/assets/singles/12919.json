In MMPSI, specifically, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000697.htm\" target=\"_blank\">partial seizures</a> generally begin shortly after birth and are often not responsive to treatment. Although the seizures may occur relatively infrequently in the beginning, within a few months the frequency increases drastically with some affected people experiencing clusters of 5 to 30 seizures several times per day. Signs and symptoms associated with these episodes vary based on which part of the brain is affected during a given seizure. Although the seizures associated with MMPSI do eventually become less frequent, the long-term consequences of the condition may include profound developmental delay, microcephaly (unusually small head size), intellectual disability and a shortened lifespan (many do not survive past infancy or early childhood).[11073][11074][11075] Although the underlying cause of MMPSI is not fully understood,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/de-novo-mutation/\" target=\"_blank\">de novo</a></em> mutations in certain <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/malignant-migrating-partial-seizures-of-infancy/show/Related+Gene(s)\" target=\"_blank\">genes</a> have been identified in several affected people and are thought to be involved in the development of the condition. Even when a genetic cause is identified, most cases of MMPSI occur <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/sporadic/\" target=\"_blank\">sporadically</a> in people with no family history of the condition.[11073] Treatment is generally focused on minimizing recurrent seizures. Unfortunately, the seizures associated with MMPSI are usually not well-controlled with medications that are typically prescribed to treat epilepsy.[11074][11075]","dateModified":"2016-03-30T15:07:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
