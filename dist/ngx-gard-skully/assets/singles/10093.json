This is also called iron overload. Accumulation of iron in the organs is toxic and can cause organ damage. While many organs can be affected, iron overload is especially likely to affect the liver, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bloodheartandcirculation.html\">heart</a>, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/8883.htm\">pancreas</a>. Early symptoms of hemochromatosis type 3 can include <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/fatigue.html\">fatigue</a>, weakness, and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003261.htm\">joint pain</a>.

A diagnosis of hemochromatosis type 3 is suspected when a doctor observes signs and symptoms of the disease. A doctor may decide to order laboratory tests including a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003895.htm\">liver biopsy</a>, <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003335.htm\">MRI</a>, or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003488.htm\">blood test</a>. The diagnosis can be confirmed with <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/testing/genetictesting\">genetic testing</a>.[1364] Treatment of hemochromatosis type 3 usually involves reducing iron levels by removing blood (<a href=\"http://www.irondisorders.org/phlebotomy\">phlebotomy</a>) or <a href=\"http://www.irondisorders.org/chelation-therapy\">iron chelation</a>.
