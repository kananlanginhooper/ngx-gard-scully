Some people have no symptoms, while others may experience itchiness (sometimes severe), discomfort, or blistering.[8958][8959] It often lasts for years and can cause permanent scarring.

Patients experience different degrees of discomfort. When lichen sclerosus occurs on parts of the body other than the genital area, most often there are no symptoms, other than itching.
