In ADPEAF, specifically, most affected people experience <a href=\"http://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-seizures/secondarily-generalized-seizures\" target=\"_blank\">secondary generalized seizures</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000697.htm\" target=\"_blank\">partial seizures</a>, some of which are associated with sound-related symptoms (such as buzzing, humming, or ringing) and/or receptive aphasia (inability to understand written or spoken words). Less commonly, seizures may cause visual hallucinations, a disturbance in the sense of smell, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000692.htm\" target=\"_blank\">vertigo</a>, or other symptoms affecting the senses. Signs and symptoms of the condition generally begin in adolescence or early adulthood.[11104][11105][11106] ADPEAF is caused by changes (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>) in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LGI1\" target=\"_blank\">LGI1</a></em> or <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/RELN\" target=\"_blank\">RELN</a></em> gene and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner.
