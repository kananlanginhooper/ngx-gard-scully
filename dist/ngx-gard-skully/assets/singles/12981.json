Mast cells are present throughout most of our bodies and secrete different chemicals during allergic reactions.  Symptoms include episodes of abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, flushing, itching, wheezing, coughing, lightheadedness and potential problems with \"brain fog\" or other difficulties with memory.[10031][11133][11135] The cause of MCAS is unknown.
