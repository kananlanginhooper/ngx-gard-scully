They also may abnormalities in the nails, hands, and feet. Some of the eye findings present may include small eyes (microphthalmia), absent or severely underdeveloped eyes (anophthalmia), and problems with the tear ducts. People with focal dermal hypoplasia may also have distinctive facial features such as a pointed chin, small ears, notched nostrils, and a slight difference in the size and shape of the right and left sides of the face (facial asymmetry).&nbsp;Most individuals with this condition are female.&nbsp;Males usually have milder signs and symptoms than females. Although intelligence is typically unaffected, some individuals have <a href=\"http://nichcy.org/disability/specific/intellectual\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">intellectual disability</a>.

When focal dermal hypoplasia occurs in males, it always results from a new mutation in this gene that is not inherited.[4411] Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in the person; however, care usually involves a team of specialists, including dermatologists, otolaryngologist, physical/occupational therapists, and hand surgeons.[10503]<br />\r\n<br />","dateModified":"2016-02-05T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":5352,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of focal dermal hypoplasia?","answerText":"Focal dermal hypoplasia is usually evident from birth and&nbsp;primarily affects the skin, skeleton, eyes, and face.

Early in female embryonic development, one of the two X chromosomes is permanently inactivated in somatic cells (cells other than egg cells). This process, known as X-inactivation, ensures that both females and males have only one active copy of the X chromosome in each body cell. As a result, in each somatic cell, the X chromosome that contains the focal dermal hypoplasia mutation may be turned on or turned off. Usually, X-inactivation occurs randomly. When X-inactivation does not occur randomly, it is called skewed X-inactivation. [10501] Researchers suspect that the distribution of active and inactive X chromosomes may play a role in determining the severity of focal dermal hypoplasia.[10501][10503] As X-inactivation occurs in somatic cells, it does not affect the inheritance of a condition.[10501][10504][10505]<br />\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>","dateModified":"2016-01-29T13:46:00","references":[{"referenceId":10501,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Focal Dermal Hypoplasia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference","date":"July, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/focal-dermal-hypoplasia","dateAccessed":"2016-01-29T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":10503,"authors":"Sutton, V Reid and Van den Veyver, Ignatia","articleTitle":"Focal Dermal Hypoplasia","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"April, 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1543/","dateAccessed":"2016-01-29T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":10504,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Fact Sheet 14: Epigenetics","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"New South Wales Centre for Genetics Education","date":"September 30, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.genetics.edu.au/Publications-and-Resources/Genetics-Fact-Sheets/FactSheetEpigenetics","dateAccessed":"2016-01-29T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":10505,"authors":"Nussbaum, Robert, McInnes, Roderick, and Willard, Huntington","articleTitle":"","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Thompson & Thompson Genetics in Medicine","date":"2016","volume":"","pages":"91","url":"","dateAccessed":"2016-01-29T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"Philadelphia, PA","publisher":"Elsevier"}]}]}],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
