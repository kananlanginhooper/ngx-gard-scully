People with this syndrome have extra eyelashes (distichiasis) and develop puffiness or swelling (lymphedema) of the limbs, most often the legs and feet.&nbsp;The abnormal eyelashes, which grow along the inner lining of the&nbsp;eyelid, often touch the eyeball and can cause damage to the clear covering of the eye (cornea).&nbsp;Other eye problems&nbsp;such as&nbsp;an irregular curvature of the cornea causing blurred vision (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001015.htm\" target=\"_blank\">astigmatism</a>) or scarring of the cornea may also occur.
