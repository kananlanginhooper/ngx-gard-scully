The most common signs and symptoms are shortness of breath (dyspnea) during exertion and fainting spells. As the condition worsens, people can experience&nbsp;dizziness, swelling (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/edema.html\" target=_blank>edema</a>) of the ankles or legs, chest pain, and a racing pulse. Most cases of PAH occur in individuals with no family history of the disorder.

Cases with no identifiable cause may be referred to as \"idiopathic\" PAH. PAH can also occur secondary to an underlying disorder such as connective tissue diseases, HIV infection, chronic hemolytic anemia, and congenital heart disease, to name a few. PAH can also be induced by certain drugs and toxins, for example fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine (appetite suppressants now banned by the FDA), toxic rapeseed oil, and <a href=\"http://www.oas.samhsa.gov/amphetamines.htm\" target=_blank>amphetamines</a>.[6199]&nbsp;","dateModified":"2013-09-20T14:09:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":7050,"questionText":"How might pulmonary arterial hypertension be treated?","answerText":"People with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) benefit from receiving treatment at specialized centers.[6198] The <a href=\"https://phassociation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Pulmonary Hypertension Association</a> offers a <a href=\"https://phassociation.org/patients/doctorswhotreatph/\" target=\"_blank\">Find a Doctor</a> tool which may aid you in locating your nearest center.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment of serious or life threatening PAH may involve continuous IV epoprostenol.
