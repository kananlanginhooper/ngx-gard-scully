This slows the rate of shedding of the skin cells, resulting in a build-up of scales. The scales of X-linked ichthyosis are often dark and usually cover only a portion of the body. Typically, the trunk and back of the neck are more likely to be affected. Scales are usually not found on the face, scalp, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. [10940][10941] X-linked ichthyosis mostly affects males. It is usually caused by a <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a>  or <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=45\" target=\"_blank\">deletion</a>  in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/STS\" target=\"_blank\">STS</a></em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/STS\" target=\"_blank\"> gene</a> and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002051.htm\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked recessive</a>  manner. In rare cases, the ichthyosis can be part of a genetic syndrome in which other parts of the body are affected.[10941][10942] Topical treatment may consist of alpha-hydroxy acids, lubricating bath oils, and emollients.[10940][10941] For adult patients, systemic retinoids may be an option, especially during winter when the ichthyosis is often more severe. The ichthyosis is life-long, but the scaling may improve with age.[10941]<br />","dateModified":"2016-03-15T16:46:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
