Signs and symptoms vary, but may include blood clots, miscarriage, rash, chronic headaches, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/dementia.html\" target=\"_blank\">dementia</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/seizures.html\" target=\"_blank\">seizures</a>.[705] APS occurs when your body's immune system makes <a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/parent/general/body_basics/immune.html\" target=\"_blank\">antibodies</a> that attack phospholipids. Phospholipids are a type of fat found in all living cells, including blood cells and the lining of blood vessels. Most cases of APS occur in people with no family history of the disorder, however there are rare cases of APS clustering in a family. A widely accepted explanation for APS is that it is caused by a combination of gene mutations (making one more susceptible to APS) and an environmental exposure (such as to a virus). Currently there is not a cure for APS.  The goal of treatment is to prevent blood clots from forming and to keep existing clots from getting larger.[9501][9502][9503]","dateModified":"2016-05-25T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":10688,"questionText":"What causes antiphospholipid syndrome?","answerText":"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/autoimmunediseases.html\" target=\"_blank\">autoimmune disorder</a>.
