They are most often found in the <a href=\"https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/vent.html\" target=\"_blank\">fourth or lateral ventricles</a>&nbsp;in the brain, but may occur in the spine.[7213][7219] Symptoms depend on the tumor location.[13299] Some people do not have symptoms, while others may have headaches, changes in vision, and/or difficulty with balance.[7219] These symptoms are thought to be due to obstruction of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) due to the tumor's location.[7219] Most subependymomas are benign with a low recurrence rate. However, a few progress to anaplastic ependymoma (a faster growing tumor).[13299] The cause of subependymomas is not well understood. Surgery to remove the tumor is often curative.[7219]","dateModified":"2017-04-05T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":7335,"questionText":"Is subependymoma inherited?","answerText":"In the vast majority of cases, subependymomas develop sporadically; this means that they usually are not inherited and occur in people with no family history of brain tumors.
