Symptoms of this disorder include poor growth and slow weight gain in infancy.&nbsp; Additional symptoms include nearsightedness, dislocation of the lens of the eye, an increased risk of blood clots, and developmental problems.[3151] Homocystinuria due to CBS deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.[3151] It is diagnosed by newborn screening, or later in life by blood and urine testing. There are two types of homocystinuria due to CBS deficiency.&nbsp; One type responds to treatment with vitamin B6 and the other one does not.&nbsp; Other treatments for this disorder include a protein-restricted diet, betaine treatment, and other supplements.
