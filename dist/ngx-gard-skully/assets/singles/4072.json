When a family member has been diagnosed with SCA2 by genetic testing, predictive testing is available for adults in the family who show no signs of the condition (are asymptomatic). However, this testing is not useful in predicting the age of onset, severity, type of symptoms, or rate of progression in asymptomatic people.

It is recommended that people with SCA2 remain physically active, maintain a healthy weight, use adaptive equipment as needed, and avoid alcohol and medications that affect cerebellar function. Adaptive equipment may include canes or other devices to help with walking and mobility. People with SCA2 may develop difficulty speaking and may need to use computerized devices or writing pads to help with communication. Levodopa may be prescribed to help with some of the movement problems (e.g., rigidity and tremor), and magnesium may improve muscle cramping.[1209][1210][1211]","dateModified":"2014-01-31T17:15:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":1209,"authors":"Pulst SM","articleTitle":"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"November 12, 2015","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1275/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":1210,"authors":"Lastres-Becker I, Rüb U, Auburger G","articleTitle":"Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2)","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Cerebellum","date":"2008"},{"referenceId":1211,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Spinocerebellar degenerations","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Neuromuscular Disease Center at Washington University","date":"2009","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://neuromuscular.wustl.edu/ataxia/domatax.html#sca2","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":1963,"questionText":"How can I learn more about clinical trials investigating new therapies for spinocerebellar ataxia type&nbsp;2?","answerText":"<p>The U.S. National Institutes of Health, through the National Library of Medicine, developed <a href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> to provide patients, family members, and members of the public with current information on clinical research studies.
