People in an ethnic group often share certain versions of their genes, which have been passed down from common ancestors. If one of these shared genes contains a disease-causing mutation, a particular genetic disorder may be more frequently seen in the group.\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><br />\r\nThis is similar to what is seen in </span><a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000527.htm\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">sickle cell anemia</a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">, which is more common in people of African, African-American, or Mediterranean heritage and </span><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=taysachsdisease\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"color: #0000ee;\">Tay-Sachs disease</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">, which is more likely to occur among people of Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish or French Canadian ancestry.[1715]&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>In addition,&nbsp;this condition has been most frequently reported in Japan and was initially described in that country, probably leading to a heightened clinical awareness not shared in the United States [and elsewhere].
