In annular atrophic LP, specifically, affected people develop skin lesions with features of both <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/12674/annular-lichen-planus/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">annular LP </a>and <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/12675/atrophic-lichen-planus/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">atrophic LP</a> - ring-shaped, slightly raised, purple lesions with central atrophy (tissue breakdown). Although these lesions can be found anywhere on the body, they most commonly affect the trunk and legs. The exact underlying cause of annular atrophic LP is unknown.[9328][9329] Treatment is not always necessary as some cases of annular atrophic LP resolve on their own. Mild cases that are diagnosed early can often be managed with <a href=\"http://dermnetnz.org/treatments/topical-steroids.html\" target=\"_blank\">topical steroids</a>, while more intensive therapies may be required for severe cases.[9329]","dateModified":"2015-07-16T14:28:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":9278,"authors":"Güngör S, Topal IO & Göncü EK","articleTitle":"Dermoscopic patterns in active and regressive lichen planus and lichen planus variants: a morphological study","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Dermatol Pract Concept","date":"April 30, 2015","volume":"5(2)","pages":"45-53","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4462898/","dateAccessed":"2015-07-10T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12344,"relatedDiseaseName":"Rare lichen planus","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
