People with autoimmune encephalitis may have various neurologic and/or psychiatric symptoms. Neurologic symptoms may include impaired memory and cognition, abnormal movements, seizures, and/or problems with balance, speech, or vision.[13990][9666] Psychiatric symptoms may include <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/raise/what-is-psychosis.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">psychosis</a>, aggression, inappropriate sexual behaviors, panic attacks, compulsive behaviors, euphoria or fear. Symptoms may fluctuate, but often progress over days to a few weeks. Symptoms can progress to loss of consciousness or even coma.[13990]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAutoimmune encephalitis may be associated with antibodies to proteins on the surface of nerve cells, or within nerve cells. Some of these proteins are involved in passing signals between nerve cells.[13990][9669][13991] In some cases it occurs in association with cancer (a <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Paraneoplastic-Syndromes-Information-Page\" target=\"_blank\">paraneoplastic syndrome</a>).[9669][13990] Research regarding why specific antibodies attack the body's healthy cells is ongoing. Autoimmune encephalitis generally occurs&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/sporadic/\" target=\"_blank\">sporadically</a>, in people with no family history of the condition.[9666]<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nTreatment may involve intravenous <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=45728\" target=\"_blank\">immunosuppressive therapy</a>, and tumor removal when necessary. Early treatment decreases the likelihood for long-term complications, speeds recovery, and reduces the risk of recurrence (relapse). If not treated, the condition can lead to progressive neurologic deterioration and loss of life.[9669]","dateModified":"2017-10-26T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":12794,"questionText":"How is autoimmune encephalitis diagnosed?","answerText":"Diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis can be made when all three of the following criteria have been met:[13991]\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1.\tSubacute onset (rapid progression of less than 3 months) of working\r\nmemory deficits (short-term memory loss), altered mental status, or\r\npsychiatric symptoms\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2.\tAt least one of the following:\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n&bull;\tNew focal CNS findings\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n&bull;\tSeizures not explained by a previously known seizure disorder\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n&bull;\tCSF pleocytosis (white blood cell count of more than five cells per mm3)\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n&bull;\tMRI features suggestive of encephalitis<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3.\tReasonable exclusion of alternative causes<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA team of leading autoimmune encephalitis researchers have established\r\ndiagnostic criteria for these conditions.
