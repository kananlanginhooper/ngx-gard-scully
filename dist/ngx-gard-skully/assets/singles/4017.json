Symptoms of OHS usually begin in early childhood. They may include wedge-shaped calcium deposits at the base of the skull (occipital horns), loose skin and joints, and dysfunction of the nerves that regulate nonvoluntary body functions (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/autonomicnervoussystemdisorders.html\" target=\"_blank\">dysautonomia</a>). Other symptoms may include bladder diverticula, coarse hair, low muscle tone, and mild intellectual disability. This condition is a milder form of <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/1521/menkes-disease\" target=\"_blank\">Menkes disease</a>, which affects copper levels in the body. OHS is caused by genetic changes (<a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/776887\" target=\"_blank\">DNA variants</a>) in the <em>ATP7A</em> gene, and it is inherited in an x-linked recessive pattern. It can be diagnosed based on the symptoms, genetic testing, and other blood tests. Treatment for OHS is based on managing the symptoms.[4921][15566][15567][15568]&nbsp;&nbsp;","dateModified":"2020-05-14T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13444,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of occipital horn syndrome?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with occipital horn syndrome.
