Other symptoms may include loss of acquired skills (developmental regression), behavioral problems, stiffness or tightness of the muscles (spasticity), problems coordinating movements, small head, unusual facial features, and short stature. Some individuals also develop mental disorders such as anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and stereotyped behaviors.
