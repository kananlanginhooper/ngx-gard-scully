Cone cells allow a person to see color and&nbsp;fine detail, and they&nbsp;work best in bright light.&nbsp;The cone dystrophies can cause a variety of symptoms such as decreased visual clarity when looking straight ahead, a reduced ability to see colors, and an increased sensitivity to light.[3502] There are two main subtypes of cone dystrophy, called stationary cone dystrophy and progressive cone dystrophy. The age when symptoms begin, the type and severity of symptoms, and the progression of symptoms are all very different between individuals, even between people with&nbsp;the same type of cone dystrophy.[3502] Mutations in many genes have been found to cause cone dystrophy, and the condition can be inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=_blank>autosomal dominant</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=_blank>autosomal recessive</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002051.htm\" target=_blank>x-linked</a>&nbsp;manner.[6067]","dateModified":"2013-07-01T15:12:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":7695,"questionText":"How is cone dystrophy diagnosed?","answerText":"The diagnosis of cone dystrophy is made based upon the presence of characteristic symptoms, a detailed family history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a number of supporting tests.

Then a series of flashes of light are used to stimulate the retina. Doctors can then measure the electrical response of the rods and cones to the light. The test is performed twice &ndash; once in&nbsp; bright room and again in a dark room.
