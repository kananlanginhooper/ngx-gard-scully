Although the condition can affect people of all ages, it generally occurs in older people (the median age of diagnosis is between 60 and 67 years). Signs and symptoms include prolonged bleeding, frequent nosebleeds, bruising throughout the body, solid swellings of congealed blood (hematomas), <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003138.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hematuria</a>, and gastrointestinal or urologic bleeding. Acquired hemophilia A occurs when the body's immune system attacks and disables a certain protein that helps the blood clot (called coagulation factor VIII). About half of the cases are associated with other conditions, such as pregnancy, <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000816.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autoimmune disease</a>, cancer, skin diseases, or allergic reactions to medications. Treatment is aimed at controlling bleeding episodes and addressing the underlying cause of the condition.[9266][9267]","dateModified":"2015-07-09T15:17:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":10418,"relatedDiseaseName":"Hemophilia","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
