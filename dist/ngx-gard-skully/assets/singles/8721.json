One or both sides of the body may be affected. The episodes can sometimes be preceded by a crawling or tingling sensation in the affected body part and do not involve a loss of consciousness.[8966][8967] Individuals with paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis usually begin to show signs and symptoms of the disorder during childhood or adolescence. Episodes typically last less than 5 minutes, though they may last up to several hours. The frequency of episodes ranges from one per month to 100 per day. In most cases, the episodes occur less often with age.[8966][8967]","dateModified":"2015-05-27T10:27:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":11949,"relatedDiseaseName":"Dystonia","relation":"Parent","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":false}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
