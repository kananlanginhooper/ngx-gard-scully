By the end of the first decade of life and certainly by their early teens, all individuals with typical mucolipidosis IV have severe visual impairment as a result of retinal degeneration. Neurodegeneration is thought to occur in no more than 15% of individuals. About 5% of individuals have atypical mucolipidosis IV, often manifest as less severe psychomotor retardation and/or eye findings. Although in the past, mucolipidosis IV was considered an Ashkenazi Jewish disease, currently most affected individuals are non-Ashkenazi Jewish.","Disease__c":"Mucolipidosis type 4","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C0238286","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
