If myelin is damaged, these impulses slow down. Symptoms of HSAN include diminished sensation of pain and its associated consequences of delayed healing, <a href=\"https://www.aofas.org/footcaremd/conditions/diabetic-foot/Pages/Charcot-Arthropathy.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Charcot arthopathies</a>, infections, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000437.htm\" target=\"_blank\">osteomyelitis</a>, and amputations.[9874][11197] They have been categorized into types one through five, although some children do not fit well into this classification and do not all have altered pain sensation and/or autonomic function.[9873]&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/6635/hereditary-sensory-neuropathy-type-1/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">HSAN type I</a> is the most common form of HSAN.
