The neonatal type is the most severe form, with symptoms developing soon after birth. The late-infantile type is the most common form and usually presents as progressive loss of mental abilities and movement after a period of normal development. The juvenile type is rare, with a slow regression of psychomotor development in mid to late childhood. Life expectancy is shortened in all types.[10730] Multiple sulfatase deficiency is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SUMF1\" target=\"_blank\">SUMF1</a></em> gene. It is inherited in an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>&nbsp;pattern.[10730][10731] There is no cure for multiple sulfatase deficiency.
