Early in development, this plate of cells forms the neural tube, a narrow sheath that closes between the third and fourth weeks of pregnancy to form the brain and spinal cord of the embryo. Four main processes are responsible for the development of the nervous system: cell proliferation, the process in which nerve cells divide to form new generations of cells; cell migration, the process in which nerve cells move from their place of origin to the place where they will remain for life; cell differentiation, the process during which cells acquire individual characteristics; and cell death, a natural process in which cells die. Damage to the developing nervous system is a major cause of chronic, disabling disorders and, sometimes, death in infants, children, and even adults. The degree to which damage to the developing nervous system harms the mind and body varies enormously.[142]","dateModified":"2013-07-08T13:23:00","references":[{"referenceId":142,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Cephalic Disorders Fact Sheet","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke","date":"2007","url":"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/cephalic_disorders/detail_cephalic_disorders.htm?css=print","dateAccessed":"2008-02-01T00:00:00"}]},{"questionId":202,"questionText":"What is colpocephaly?","answerText":"<strong>Colpocephaly</strong> is a congenital brain abnormality in which the occipital horns - the posterior or rear portion of the lateral ventricles (cavities) of the brain - are larger than normal because white matter in the posterior cerebrum has failed to develop or thicken.[141]&nbsp;&nbsp;","dateModified":"2012-11-12T12:20:00","references":[{"referenceId":141,"authors":"","articleTitle":"NINDS Colpocephaly Information Page","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke","date":"","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Colpocephaly-Information-Page","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":203,"questionText":"Is colpocephaly rare?","answerText":"Yes.
