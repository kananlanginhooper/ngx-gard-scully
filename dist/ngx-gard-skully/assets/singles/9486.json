In these people, the exact underlying cause of the condition is unknown. Scientists suspect that the condition is due to abnormal development of the olfactory system (the sensory system used for sense of smell) prior to birth.

In these families, inheritance appears to be  <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> with <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/inheritance/penetranceexpressivity\" target=\"_blank\">reduced penetrance</a>.[9024][9025] Autosomal dominant inheritance&nbsp;means that having a change (<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a>) in only one copy of the responsible&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a>&nbsp;in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition.&nbsp;Reduced penetrance means that not all people who have or inherit the mutation will be affected. When a person with a mutation that causes an autosomal dominant condition has children (whether they are affected or not), each child has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit that mutation. For conditions with reduced penetrance, it is not possible to predict whether a child who inherits the mutation will be affected.
