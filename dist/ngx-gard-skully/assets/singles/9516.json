There may be fever and extensive, painful loss of skin tissue as well as secondary infection of the ulcers. Diagnosis of FUMHD is confirmed by biopsy of skin lesions. FUMHD occurs more frequently in children, peaking at age 5 to 10.[1503] Males tend to be affected more often than females.[1499][1503] While some cases of FUMHD have resolved without therapy, others have resulted in death.

The case reports describe treatment with systemic steroids, methotrexate, antibiotics, dapsone, cyclosporine, psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA), ultraviolet B (UVB), unspecified ultraviolet receptor, acyclovir, immunoglobulins, and 4,4-diaminodiphenylsulphone (DDS). Again the efficacy of these therapies are not known.[1498][1499][1500][1503][1504][9642][9643]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAcyclovir was prescribed in cases where varicella was initially suspected. None of these cases turned out to be associated with herpes simplex or varicella-zoster virus infection. The benefit of acyclovir therapy in people with FUMHD is questionable.[1499] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSystemic steroids have been commonly utilized among reported cases (27 of 40 cases), with only one report of a positive effect.[1504] Methotrexate has been used in 15 patients. It induced rapid remissions and was successful in cases that did not respond to other therapies. Still four patients died despite methotrexate theapy. It is possible this was&nbsp;due to its late institution.[1504] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDebridement and skin grafting was successful in one case, but the patient was left with considerable scaring.[1498] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn advanced disease, therapy is also aimed at stabilizing the patient. Intensive care treatment of infection and maintenance of the patient&rsquo;s general condition is vital.[1498][1504] <span style=\"font-size: 14.4px;\">The state of these patients is similar to what is seen in patients with severe burns.

The case reports describe treatment with systemic steroids, methotrexate, antibiotics, dapsone, cyclosporine, psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA), ultraviolet B (UVB), unspecified ultraviolet receptor, acyclovir, immunoglobulins, and 4,4-diaminodiphenylsulphone (DDS). Again the efficacy of these therapies are not known.[1498][1499][1500][1503][1504][9642][9643]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAcyclovir was prescribed in cases where varicella was initially suspected.

The case reports describe treatment with systemic steroids, methotrexate, antibiotics, dapsone, cyclosporine, psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA), ultraviolet B (UVB), unspecified ultraviolet receptor, acyclovir, immunoglobulins, and 4,4-diaminodiphenylsulphone (DDS). Again the efficacy of these therapies are not known.[1498][1499][1500][1503][1504][9642][9643]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAcyclovir was prescribed in cases where varicella was initially suspected. None of these cases turned out to be associated with herpes simplex or varicella-zoster virus infection. The benefit of acyclovir therapy in people with FUMHD is questionable.[1499] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSystemic steroids have been commonly utilized among reported cases (27 of 40 cases), with only one report of a positive effect.[1504] Methotrexate has been used in 15 patients. It induced rapid remissions and was successful in cases that did not respond to other therapies. Still four patients died despite methotrexate theapy. It is possible this was&nbsp;due to its late institution.[1504] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDebridement and skin grafting was successful in one case, but the patient was left with considerable scaring.[1498] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn advanced disease, therapy is also aimed at stabilizing the patient. Intensive care treatment of infection and maintenance of the patient&rsquo;s general condition is vital.[1498][1504] <span style=\"font-size: 14.4px;\">The state of these patients is similar to what is seen in patients with severe burns.
