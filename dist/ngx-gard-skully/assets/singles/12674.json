In annular LP, specifically, affected people develop&nbsp;ring-shaped, slightly raised, purple&nbsp;lesions with no central atrophy (tissue breakdown). Purely annular LP is very rare; however, annular lesions occur in approximately 10% of all cases of lichen planus.[9321][9322] The exact underlying cause of annular LP is unknown.[9325] Treatment is not always necessary as some cases of annular LP resolve on their own. Mild cases can often be managed with <a href=\"http://dermnetnz.org/treatments/topical-steroids.html\" target=\"_blank\">topical steroids</a>, while more intensive therapies may be required for severe cases.[9322][9321]","dateModified":"2015-07-16T13:18:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[{"referenceId":9277,"authors":"Reich HL, Nguyen JT & James WD","articleTitle":"","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"J Am Acad Dermatol","date":"April, 2004","volume":"50(4)","pages":"595-9","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15034510","dateAccessed":"2015-07-10T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":9278,"authors":"Güngör S, Topal IO & Göncü EK","articleTitle":"Dermoscopic patterns in active and regressive lichen planus and lichen planus variants: a morphological study","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Dermatol Pract Concept","date":"April 30, 2015","volume":"5(2)","pages":"45-53","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4462898/","dateAccessed":"2015-07-10T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12344,"relatedDiseaseName":"Rare lichen planus","relation":"Parent","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
