Children whose epilepsy is a result of a specific condition (such as schizencephaly) have lower survival rates than the normal population, but this is most often due to the underlying condition.[2904] <br />\n<br />\nBoth clinical and laboratory studies show that seizures early in life can result in permanent behavioral abnormalities.[2903] In general, the earlier a child has seizures and the more extensive the area of the brain affected, the poorer the outcome. Children with seizures that are not well-controlled are at higher risk for intellectual decline. Learning and language problems as well as emotional and behavioral disorders occur in a significant number of children with epilepsy.[2904] It is worth noting, however, that progressive mental deterioration is often related to the neurologic disorder that caused the seizures rather than to the seizures themselves.[2902]<br />","dateModified":"2014-11-18T00:00:00","references":[{"referenceId":2902,"authors":"Bula Adamolekun","articleTitle":"Seizure Disorders","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Merck Manuals","date":"March 2008","url":"http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/sec16/ch214/ch214a.html","dateAccessed":"2011-01-17T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":2903,"authors":"Holmes GL","articleTitle":"Effects of seizures on brain development: lessons from the laboratory","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Pediatric Neurology","date":"July 2005","volume":"33(1)","pages":"1-11","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15993318","dateAccessed":"2011-01-17T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":2904,"authors":"Harvey Simon","articleTitle":"Epilepsy - Prognosis","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"University of Maryland Medical Center","date":"February 11, 2009","url":"http://www.umm.edu/patiented/articles/how_epilepsy_diagnosed_000044_4.htm","dateAccessed":"2011-01-17T00:00:00"}]},{"questionId":3970,"questionText":"What is the long-term outlook for people with schizencephaly?","answerText":"The long-term outlook for people with schizencephaly varies depending on the size and location of the clefts and the extent of intellectual disabilities.[7884][7885] For example, children with a small cleft in one hemisphere may have paralysis on one side of the body and little to no intellectual disability, while clefts in both hemispheres can lead to quadriplegia (paralysis of both arms and legs) and severe intellectual disability.[7885]","dateModified":"2014-11-18T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Prognosis","references":[{"referenceId":7884,"authors":"","articleTitle":"NINDS Schizencephaly Information Page","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke","date":"April 16, 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/schizencephaly/schizencephaly.htm","dateAccessed":"2014-11-17T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":7885,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Schizencephaly","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Orphanet","date":"May 2014","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?Lng=GB&Expert=799","dateAccessed":"2014-11-17T00:00:00","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]}]}],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
