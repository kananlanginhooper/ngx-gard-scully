Porphyrias are caused by an abnormality in the heme production process. Heme is essential in enabling our blood cells to carry oxygen and in breaking down chemical compounds in the liver. Erythropoietic protoporphyria is caused by pathogenic variants (mutations) in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FECH\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FECH</em></a> gene which lead to an impaired activity of ferrocheletase (FECH), an important enzyme in heme production. This results in the build-up of protoporphyrin in the bone marrow, red blood cells, blood plasma, skin, and eventually liver. Build up of protoporphyrin can cause extreme sensitivity to sunlight, liver damage, abdominal pain, gallstones, and enlargement of the spleen.[761] Inheritance is autosomal recessive.[761][10998]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment includes avoiding sun and UV light exposure, vitamin D supplements, creams for tanning, and using protective clothing.
