The chance this same mistake will happen again is low. So if a person without KdVS has a child with KdVS, the risk of having other children with the KdVS is low (probably less than 1 in 100).[13141]\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf a person with KdVS has a child, then there is a 50% chance their child will have KdVS.
