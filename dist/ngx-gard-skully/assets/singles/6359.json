While many people with an autosomal dominant form of EB have a parent with EB, some cases result from a new mutation, occurring for the first time (called a <em><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/de-novo-mutation/\" target=\"_blank\">de novo</a></em><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/de-novo-mutation/\" target=\"_blank\"> mutation</a>).

When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% chance to inherit the mutated copy of the gene. While many people with an autosomal dominant form of EB have a parent with EB, some cases result from a new mutation, occurring for the first time (called a <em><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/de-novo-mutation/\" target=\"_blank\">de novo</a></em><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/de-novo-mutation/\" target=\"_blank\"> mutation</a>). A person with a <em>de novo</em> mutation still has a 50% chance to pass the mutation on to each of his/her children.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn autosomal recessive inheritance, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell to have EB. Typically, a person with EB inherits one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who are referred to as carriers. Carriers usually do not have symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% chance to be affected, a 50% chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent, and a 25% chance to not be a carrier&nbsp;<em>and</em> not be affected.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/6360/epidermolysis-bullosa-acquisita/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita</a> (an acquired form of EB) is a rare autoimmune disorder and is not inherited.</p>","dateModified":"2018-04-18T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[{"referenceId":7770,"authors":"Intong LR, Murrell DF","articleTitle":"Inherited epidermolysis bullosa: new diagnostic criteria and classification","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Clin Dermatol","date":"January-February, 2012","volume":"30(1)","pages":"70-77","url":"","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":14553,"authors":"Laimer M, Bauer J, Murrell DF","articleTitle":"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, classification, and clinical features of epidermolysis bullosa","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"UpToDate","date":"June 21, 2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-classification-and-clinical-features-of-epidermolysis-bullosa","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"Waltham, MA","publisher":"UpToDate"}]},{"questionId":7811,"questionText":"If a person with epidermolysis bullosa has no family history of the disease, how is the mode of inheritance established?","answerText":"Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) can have either an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive mode of inheritance in epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) and&nbsp;dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB).&nbsp;Kindler syndrome and junctional epidermalysis bullosa (with the exception of one report, to our knowledge) are autosomal recessive.[7770][5378] The mode of inheritance in a given family is usually established by analyzing the family history (pedigree analysis).[5378]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEBS in families in which only one child is affected (and the parents are unaffected) could be either autosomal dominant (as the result of a <em><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK5191/def-item/de-novo-mutation/\" target=\"_blank\">de novo</a></em> gene mutation) or autosomal recessive.
