The main features are muscle weakness present at birth, club foot, fixed joints (joint contractures), and curvature of the spine.&nbsp;The symptoms of this condition vary.

Many people with this condition are at risk to have complications under general anesthesia (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001315.htm\" target=\"_blank\">malignant hyperthermia</a>).&nbsp;Muscle weakness may get slowly worse over time or stay the same. Most people with STAC3 disorders are shorter than average and have normal intelligence. This condition is caused by genetic alterations in the <em>STAC3</em> gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.&nbsp;STAC3 disorder is diagnosed based on the symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing.
