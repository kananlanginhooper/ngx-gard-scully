This disorder&nbsp;is characterized by&nbsp;muscle weakness that appears in late adolescence or early adulthood and worsens over time.[5664] Early symptoms&nbsp;typically develop&nbsp;in the 20s and 30s and may include difficulty running or walking, tripping, weakness in the index finger, and frequent loss of balance.[5665]&nbsp;Inclusion body myopathy 2 is caused by mutations in the <span class=\"geneSymbol\"><em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GNE\" target=\"_blank\">GNE</a></em></span> gene.

Weakness in the tibialis anterior alters the way a person walks and makes it difficult to run and climb stairs. As the disorder progresses, weakness also develops in muscles of the upper legs, hips, shoulders, and hands. Unlike most forms of myopathy, inclusion body myopathy 2 usually does not affect the quadriceps (a group of large muscles at the front of the thigh). This condition also&nbsp;spares muscles of the eye or heart, and does not cause neurological problems. Weakness in leg muscles makes walking increasingly difficult, and most people with inclusion body myopathy 2 require wheelchair assistance within 20 years after signs and symptoms appear.[5664]","dateModified":"2014-01-13T10:03:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":5664,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Inclusion body myopathy 2","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"December 2008","url":"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/inclusion-body-myopathy-2","dateAccessed":"2012-12-04T00:00:00"}]},{"questionId":6574,"questionText":"What causes inclusion body myopathy 2?","answerText":"Inclusion body myopathy 2 is caused by mutations in the <span class=\"geneSymbol\"><em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GNE\" target=\"_blank\">GNE</a></em></span> gene.
