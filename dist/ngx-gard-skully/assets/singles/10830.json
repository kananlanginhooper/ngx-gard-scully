It is an unusual birthmark in which the melanocytes (pigment cells) are found deeper than normal in the skin. This type of birthmark is usually located on the shoulder and upper arm area on one side of the body. It can sometimes be associated with sensory changes in the involved skin area. Very rarely does nevus of Ito become cancerous. The exact cause is unknown. They are&nbsp;most commonly found in Asian populations and appear more frequently in females. They are very uncommon in Caucasians.[4423][4424]","dateModified":"2011-09-28T16:37:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
