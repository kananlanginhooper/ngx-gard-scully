People with&nbsp;this condition&nbsp;experience fatigue, muscle pain, and cramps during exercise (exercise intolerance). In some people,&nbsp;high-intensity exercise or other strenuous activity leads to the breakdown of muscle tissue (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000473.htm\" target=_blank>rhabdomyolysis</a>), which can lead to myoglobinuria (rust-colored urine indicating breakdown of muscle tissue) and kidney damage. A skin rash may also develop. The severity of the signs and symptoms varies greatly among affected individuals. Lactate dehydrogenase A deficiency is caused by mutations in the <span class=geneSymbol><em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LDHA\" target=_blank>LDHA</a></em></span> gene.
