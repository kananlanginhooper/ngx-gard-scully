In some cases, treatment may include medications used for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (<a href=\"https://parkinson.org/Understanding-Parkinsons/Treatment/Prescription-Medications/Levodopa\">levodopa</a> or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a697029.html\">pramipexole</a>), and/or <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/botox/about/pac-20384658\">botulinum toxin (Botox) injections</a> in the leg muscles. More than one therapy may be tried before finding one that helps.[3449] POT does not appear to alter life expectancy. However, quality of life for people with POT may be severely impaired due to physical symptoms, fear of falling, and uncertainty about the course of the disorder.[15224]","dateModified":"2019-01-25T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
