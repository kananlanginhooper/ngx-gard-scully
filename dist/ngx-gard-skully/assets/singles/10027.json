Symptoms of campomelic dysplasia may include bowing of the legs, dislocated hips, small lungs and chest, and external genitalia that do not look clearly male or clearly female (ambiguous genitalia). In addition, infants with campomelic dysplasia have distinctive facial features including a small chin with cleft palate, prominent eyes, flat face, and a large head. Many infants die at an early age due to breathing problems.
