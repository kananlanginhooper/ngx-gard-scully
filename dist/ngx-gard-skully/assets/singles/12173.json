Seizures typically begin within a few months after birth and are difficult to control with medications. Most children have 1 to 5 seizures every day. Other symptoms include problems with sleeping, feeding, and teeth grinding. Gastrointestinal symptoms are also common and may include constipation, reflux, and air swallowing. About 1 in 5 children use a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007235.htm\" target=\"_blank\">feeding tube</a>. CDKL5 deficiency disorder occurs more often in females than males, and males usually have more severe symptoms. This disorder is caused by a change (pathogenic variant) in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/CDKL5\" target=\"_blank\">CDKL5</a></em> gene that is usually not inherited from either parent (de novo).
