All forms of CJD belong to a rare family of progressive neurodegenerative disorders that affect both humans and animals, called <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/prions/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">prion diseases</a>. The term \"prion\" refers to abnormal proteins within the brain, called <a href=\"http://memory.ucsf.edu/cjd/overview/prions\" target=\"_blank\">prion proteins</a>. vCJD, described primarily in the United Kingdom and France, accounts for less than 1% of cases of CJD, and tends to affect younger people. It can result when someone is exposed to contaminated products. The infection responsible for the disease in cows&nbsp;(<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/prions/bse/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">bovine spongiform encephalitis</a>) is believed to be the same one responsible for vCJD in humans.[928][929][930]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother variant, called the panencephalopathic form, occurs primarily in Japan and has a relatively long course, with symptoms often progressing for several years.&nbsp;Scientists are trying to&nbsp;gain a better understanding&nbsp;about what causes these variations in the symptoms and course of the disease.[928]There is no specific treatment for CJD or vCJD, so the goal is to make a person as comfortable as possible.[928][929][930]","dateModified":"2016-07-05T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[{"caseId":23499,"abbreviatedInquiry":"Can you tell me if variant&nbsp;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&nbsp;(vCJD) can be sexually transmitted?
