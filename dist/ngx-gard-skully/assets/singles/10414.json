","answerText":"Surgical resection (removing the abnormal tissue) is the primary treatment for goblet cell carcinoid (GCC). However, due to the condition's rarity, there is a lack of ample evidence or general consensus regarding the extent to which resection should be performed for different stages of this condition.[6055]<br><br>Because of the typical course of the condition and the malignant nature of the tumors, treatment recommendations are more similar to that of adenocarcinomas rather than most carcinoids. Stage I tumors may be treated with <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002921.htm\" target=_blank>appendectomy</a> alone. However, in higher stages, a <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/medical/IM00231\" target=_blank>right hemicolectomy</a> (RH) is the most commonly recommended surgical option despite controversy in the medical community. The justification for RH is to do adequate nodal sampling (when samples are taken to check for more cancer) because metastasis is common. Some researches have reported a lack of benefit from extensive surgery provided there is no nodal involvement. It has also been reported by some researchers that in patients studied, the 5-year survival rates were not significantly different between those treated with appendectomy and those who underwent RH.[6055] Careful follow-up after surgery is highly recommended and may include periodic physical examinations, blood testing, and imaging studies.[5093] In some cases, <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/adjuvant-therapy/CA00012\" target=_blank>adjuvant chemotherapy</a> is also recommended.[6055]<br><br>We are unable to give advice to individuals regarding the best course of treatment.
