The signs and symptoms of this disorder vary greatly but may include &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000360.htm\" target=\"_blank\">osteoporosis</a>  (loss of bone mass), compression fractures, skull deformities, and curvature of the spine (scoliosis). The abnormalities associated with this condition may lead to short stature. Loss of bone (osteolysis) in the hands and feet is a characteristic feature of this condition. Other features of AOD may include distinctive facial features, loose joints, dental problems, excess body hair, recurrent infections, heart defects, and kidney abnormalities. AOD is caused by mutations in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/NOTCH2\" target=\"_blank\">NOTCH2</a></em> gene. The mutation can be inherited from a parent, or it can be the result of a new mutation in the affected individual.
