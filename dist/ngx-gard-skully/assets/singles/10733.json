Symptoms of IPEH may include a soft mass under the skin and reddish-blue coloring on the skin. Other symptoms may depend on the location of the IPEH. The most common areas of the body for IPEH to occur are the head, neck, lower limbs, and fingers. If left untreated, the tumor can cause damage to the tissue around it and become infected. The cause is unknown. Diagnosis is made by imaging studies and a biopsy to remove a piece of the tumor for examination by a pathologist. Treatment usually includes surgery to remove the tumor.[15815][15816][15817][15818]","dateModified":"2020-09-22T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":13663,"questionText":"What are the signs and symptoms of intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia?","answerText":"The following list includes the most common signs and symptoms in people with intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia (IPEH).
