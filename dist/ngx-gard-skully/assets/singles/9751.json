Dry mouth and dental involvement can occur. Joint pain (arthralgias), muscular pain, weakness, cramps, and destruction of the tips of the fingers or toes (acroosteolysis) are frequent. Severe problems involving the lung (fibrosis or <a href=\"https://www.phassociation.org/AboutPH\" target=\"_blank\">pulmonary hypertension</a>)  and kidney problems may also occur.[12995][12996] The exact cause of the condition is unknown.
