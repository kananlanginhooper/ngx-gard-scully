The term itself is derived from the Greek \"kamptos\" (to bend) and \"kormos\" (trunk) BSS was initially considered, especially in wartime, as a result of a psychogenic disorder. It is now recognized that in it may also be related to a number of musculo-skeletal or neurological disorders.&nbsp;It seems that myopathy is the primary cause of camptocormia based on<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003929.htm\" target=\"_blank\"> electromyography</a>, magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography (<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003330.htm\" target=\"_blank\">CT</a>/<a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/mriscans.html\" target=\"_blank\">MRI scans)&nbsp;</a>of paraspinal muscles, and <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003924.htm\" target=\"_blank\">muscle biopsy</a>.&nbsp;The majority of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2989190/table/Tab1/\" target=\"_blank\">BSS of muscular origin </a>is related to a primary idiopathic (with unknwon cause) axial myopathy of late onset, maybe a delayed-onset paraspinal myopathy, appearing in elderly patients. Causes of secondary BSS are numerous.
