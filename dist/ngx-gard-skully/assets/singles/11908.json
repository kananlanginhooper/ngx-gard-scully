Although the natural hosts of these roundworms are dogs, wild canids (such as wolves and foxes) and raccoons, humans can be infected with <em>Dirofilaria</em> larvae through mosquito bites. Signs and symptoms of dirofilariasis generally include nodules under the skin or lung granulomas (small nodules formed by an inflammatory reaction) which may be asymptomatic. Some people with dirofilariasis of the lungs may also experience cough, chest pain, fever, wheezing, chills, and pleural effusion (excess fluid between the tissues that line the lungs and the chest cavity). Dirofilariasis is treated with surgical removal of lung granulomas and skin nodules.[11370][11371]","dateModified":"2016-04-27T15:13:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":12646,"relatedDiseaseName":"Filariasis","relation":"Parent","isRare":false,"hasGardPage":false}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
