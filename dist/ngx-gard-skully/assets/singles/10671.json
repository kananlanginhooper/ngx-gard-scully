[1] One early study from 1995 of a small number of patients (48 people)&nbsp;suggested a survival rate of 100% for patients with low grade MEC of the salivary glands. The <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/median\" target=\"_blank\">median</a> follow-up period for these patients was fifteen years. [2] A later and larger study (125 patients) from 2012 suggested&nbsp;that low- and intermediate-grade MECs uniformly showed a&nbsp;favorable prognosis. In this study, the <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?CdrID=44070\" target=\"_blank\">overall survival&nbsp;rate</a> for patients with low-grade MEC was 92.8% and the <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?CdrID=44023\" target=\"_blank\">disease-free survival</a>&nbsp;rate for these patients was 88.3%. The median follow-up period in this study was about five years (with a range from 2-31 years). [3]&nbsp;This information on prognosis is&nbsp;supported by a much larger study performed in 2014&nbsp;involving a database of 2400 patients with MEC of the salivary glands. Results from this study indicate that the five year disease free survival rate for patients with low-grade MEC of the salivary glands is 98.8%. Factors indicating that patients will go on to have a poor prognosis include: high grade, increasing patient age, larger tumor size, <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?CdrID=46710\" target=\"_blank\">metastasis</a> to the lymph nodes, and <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?CdrID=415317\" target=\"_blank\">distant metastasis</a>.
