It is a subtype of the group of diseases known as <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7674/spinal-muscular-atrophy\" target=\"_blank\">spinal muscular atrophy</a>.[13069][13070][13071] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSymptoms include  delayed walking, waddling gait, difficulty walking, foot deformities, and loss of some reflexes. Joint <a href=\"http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Contractures\" target=\"_blank\">contractures</a> are reported frequently, and a few patients present with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000971.htm\" target=\"_blank\">congenital hip dysplasia</a>.[13069] Other symptoms that have being described are an exaggerated curvature&nbsp;of the lower back&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/9583.htm\" target=\"_blank\">hyperlordosis</a>), increased or decreased muscle tone, small chin (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003306.htm\" target=\"_blank\">micrognathia</a>), respiratory insufficiency, small head (microcephaly), and extra ridges or folds in the brain surface (polymicrogyria).[13071]&nbsp; Sensation and cognitive function are normal in most cases.[13069][13070] Many patients show evident atrophy of the lower limbs and a very broad upper body, which resembles a bodybuilder-like shape.[13070] The disease has very slow progression throughout life. It is caused by mutations in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/BICD2\" target=\"_blank\"><em>BICD2</em></a> gene. Inheritance is autosomal dominant.[13069][13072] There is no cure and treatment  is directed to the symptoms present in each individual patient.<br />","dateModified":"2017-02-17T10:22:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
