Patients often present with serious complications such as breathing and feeding difficulties and episodes of hyperthermia (elevated body temperature). The condition is transmitted&nbsp;in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>&nbsp;fashion and appears to be caused by mutations in the <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LIFR\" target=\"_blank\">leukemia inhibitory factor receptor gene</a> (LIFR). STWS is often fatal during the neonatal period due to respiratory distress or hyperthermic episodes. [3283][3284][3285] However, some patients do survive to adolescence and beyond.[3283][3284] Survivors may develop spinal deformities, spontaneous fractures, bowing of the lower limbs, prominent joints, and <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dysautonomia/dysautonomia.htm\" target=\"_blank\">dysautonomia</a> symptoms (including temperature instability).[3283][3285] Treatment is mainly symptomatic and should include efforts to prevent choking, physical therapy and/or surgery to address bone abnormalities, efforts to prevent vision loss, and treatment for osteopenia or <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/osteoporosis.html\" target=\"_blank\">osteoporosis</a>.
