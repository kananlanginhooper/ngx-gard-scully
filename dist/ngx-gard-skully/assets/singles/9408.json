It was originally referred to as \"juvenile breast carcinoma\" because it was first recognized in children and adolescents.[14500][14501] However, many cases reported in the last several decades have occurred in adults of all ages.[14500][14502] SBC may occur in males or females but like other types of breast cancer, it is much more common in females. Signs and symptoms of SBC most commonly include a painless, firm mass in the breast, which may move when palpated. Some people with SBC also have nipple discharge. There is currently no consensus regarding treatment for SBC, and treatment options may depend on the person's age and the size of the tumor. Options may include surgery to remove the tumor or breast (mastectomy), surgery to also remove nearby lymph nodes, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. SBC may recur in some cases, but when this happens, it is often in the same area of the breast and after a long period of time (called a late local recurrence). SBC is usually associated with an excellent prognosis (prolonged survival), even when it spreads (metastasizes) to the lymph nodes.[14500]&nbsp;The risk for SBC to spread to other parts of the body is thought to be extremely low.[14501]","dateModified":"2018-03-28T13:32:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
