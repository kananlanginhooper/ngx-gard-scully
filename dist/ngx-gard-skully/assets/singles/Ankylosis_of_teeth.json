Permanent molars are less frequently affected than deciduous molars. The major characteristic of a secondarily retained molar is infraocclusion, which may result in malocclusion because of tilting of the neighboring teeth and overeruption of antagonists. The disorder can also result in loss of the retained molar and neighboring teeth due to caries and periodontal disease and in deformation of the facial skeleton (Raghoebar et al., 1992).See also 125350 and 273050 for phenotypes with shared features of secondary retention of permanent molars.","Disease__c":"Ankylosis of teeth","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C0155930","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
