This may involve medications to treat infections, reduce inflammation, and remove fluid from the lungs. A breathing machine is used to deliver high doses of oxygen and continued pressure called PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) to the damaged lungs. Patients often need to be deeply sedated with medications when using this equipment. Some research suggests that giving medications to temporarily paralyze a person with ARDS will increase the chance of recovery. Treatment continues until&nbsp;the patient is&nbsp;well enough to breathe on&nbsp;his/her own.[5234] \r\n<p>More detailed information about the treatment of ARDS can be accessed through the <a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ards/treatment.html\" target=_blank>National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute</a> (NHLBI) and <a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/165139-treatment#showall\" target=_blank>Medscape Reference</a>.&nbsp;<br>An article detailing&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/oxt/\" target=_blank>Oxygen Therapy</a> is also available.</p>","dateModified":"2012-05-17T23:05:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":5234,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"MedlinePlus","date":"March 3, 2012","url":"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000103.htm","dateAccessed":"2012-05-17T00:00:00"},{"referenceId":5235,"authors":"","articleTitle":"What is ARDS?","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)","date":"January 12, 2012","url":"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/ards/","dateAccessed":"2012-05-17T00:00:00"}]}],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
