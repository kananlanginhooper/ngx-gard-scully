The loss of motor neurons causes progressive muscle weakness and loss of movement due to muscle wasting (atrophy). The severity of the symptoms, the age at which symptoms,&nbsp; begin, and genetic cause varies by type. Many types of SMA mainly affect the muscles involved in walking, sitting, arm movement, and head control. Breathing and swallowing may also become difficult as the disease progresses in many types of SMA. In some types of SMA, the loss of motor neurons makes it hard to control movement of the hands and feet.[2299][2300][2302] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSMA type 1, 2, 3, and 4 are caused by changes (pathogenic variants, also know as mutations) in the <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SMN1\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">SMN1</a></em> gene and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Extra copies of the nearby related gene, <em><a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/SMN2\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">SMN2</a>,</em> modify the severity of SMA.

Usually, the first symptom of type 0 is reduced movement of the fetus that is first seen between 30 and 36 weeks of the pregnancy. After birth, these newborns have little movement and have difficulties with swallowing and breathing.[2299] Life span is approximately 2-6 months.[4685]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 3 types of SMA that tend to affect children before the age of one (SMA type I, SMA type II, and X-linked SMA). <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/7883/spinal-muscular-atrophy-1/resources/1\" target=\"_blank\">SMA type 1</a>&nbsp;is a severe form that may be apparent at birth or the first few months of life.

People with type III are able to stand and walk without help, although they usually lose this ability later in life.[2299] SMA type IV and Finkel type occur in adulthood, usually after age 30. Symptoms of adult-onset SMA are usually mild to moderate and include muscle weakness, tremor and twitching.[2299]","dateModified":"2016-01-07T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Symptoms","references":[{"referenceId":2299,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Learning About Spinal Muscular Atrophy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"National Human Genome Research Institute","date":"February 19, 2012","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://www.genome.gov/20519681/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":2301,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Spinal muscular atrophy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"January 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/spinal-muscular-atrophy","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":4685,"authors":"Thomas W Prior, PhD, FACMG and Barry S Russman, MD","articleTitle":"Spinal Muscular Atrophy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"GeneReviews","date":"November 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1352/","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":3336,"questionText":"How is spinal muscular atrophy inherited?","answerText":"Most forms of spinal muscular atrophy (types I, II, III, and IV, specifically) are inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a> pattern.[2301] This means that to be affected, a person must have a <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">mutation</a> in both copies of the responsible <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">gene</a> in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition <em>and</em> not be a carrier.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinkel type spinal muscular atrophy is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> pattern, which means an affected person only needs a mutation in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell.[2301]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nX-linked infantile spinal muscular atrophy is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002051.htm\" tabindex=\"-1\" target=\"_blank\">X-linked</a> pattern. The gene associated with this condition is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked disorders much more frequently than females. A striking characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.[2301]","dateModified":"2016-01-07T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Inheritance","references":[{"referenceId":2301,"authors":"","articleTitle":"Spinal muscular atrophy","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Genetics Home Reference (GHR)","date":"January 2013","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/spinal-muscular-atrophy","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":3337,"questionText":"How might spinal muscular atrophy be treated?","answerText":"Treatment for SMA may vary depending on the subtype of SMA and severity of symptoms, but generally focuses on supportive care to increase the person's quality of life.
