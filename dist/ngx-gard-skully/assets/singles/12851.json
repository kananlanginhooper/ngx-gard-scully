Intellectual disability ranges from mild to severe. Other symptoms may include low muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures, behavior problems including autistic features, abnormal movements, a very small head (microcephaly), and developmental regression.[14361][14362][14363] Some children have brain malformations that can be seen in brain imaging exams.[14361]&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;This disorder</span>&nbsp;is caused by variations (mutations) in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GRIN2B\" target=\"_blank\">GRIN2B</a></em> gene, which plays a role in the transmission of signals in the brain.
