Most affected children develop nephronophthisis that often leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in infancy or childhood, a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Hepatic fibrosis and retinal dystrophy, other manifestations of ciliopathies, are also observed. Dolichocephaly, often secondary to sagittal craniosynostosis, is a primary manifestation that distinguishes CED from most other ciliopathies. Brain malformations and developmental delay may also occur.","Disease__c":"Cranioectodermal dysplasia","GARD_Name__c":null,"GARD_Synonym__c":null,"Gene_Review_ID__c":null,"Inheritance__c":null,"Description_URL__c":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/C0432235","Gard_External_ID__c":null}
