The segment of the spinal cord that has inflammation or damage determines the symptoms a person has. Generally, inflammation at one segment causes symptoms at that level and below that level. Most commonly, the upper spinal cord is affected, causing impaired leg movement, and problems controlling the bowel and bladder. The onset of symptoms may be acute (sudden, developing over hours or days) or subacute (developing over weeks).[608] The cause of transverse myelitis may be unknown (idiopathic) or it may be associated with a wide variety of underlying health problems, including infections, immune system disorders, and other inflammatory disorders.[608][609] Tests that may be used to diagnose transverse myelitis include MRI to look for compression or inflammation of the spinal cord, and a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to look for evidence of inflammation in the fluid surrounding the spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid). Treatment options may include intravenous steroids, pain medicines, <a href=\"https://www.aan.com/Guidelines/home/GetGuidelineContent/472\" target=\"_blank\">plasmapheresis</a> (also called plasma exchange), <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-beyond-the-basics\" target=\"_blank\">intravenous immunoglobulin</a> (IVIG), and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682080.html\" target=\"_blank\">cyclophosphamide</a>.[608][609] Some people have full or partial recovery from symptoms, while others do not recover any lost function in the affected parts of the body.[14474] Most people recover at least partially, although recovery can take up to 2 or 3 years. In general however, if there is no improvement within the first 6 months, a significant recovery is not likely.[608]","dateModified":"2018-03-20T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":1009,"questionText":"What symptoms are associated with transverse myelitis?","answerText":"Transverse myelitis may be either <em>acute</em> (developing over hours to several days) or <em>subacute</em> (developing over 1 to 2 weeks). Initial symptoms usually include localized lower back pain, sudden <em>paresthesias</em> (abnormal sensations such as burning, tickling, pricking, or tingling) in the legs, sensory loss, and <em>paraparesis</em> (partial paralysis of the legs). Paraparesis often progresses to <em>paraplegia</em> (paralysis of the legs and lower part of the trunk). Urinary bladder and bowel dysfunction is common. Many patients also report experiencing muscle spasms, a general feeling of discomfort, headache, fever, and loss of appetite. Depending on which segment of the spinal cord is involved, some patients may experience respiratory problems as well.[608]\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">From this wide array of symptoms, four classic features of transverse myelitis emerge:[608][610]</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Weakness of the legs and arms: </strong>Most people with transverse myelitis will experience weakness of varying degrees in their legs; some also experience it in their arms. Initially, people with this condition may notice that they are stumbling, dragging one foot or that both legs seem heavier than normal. Depending on the level of involvement within the spinal cord, coordination or strength in the hands and arms may also be affected.[608][610]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Pain:</strong>&nbsp;Up to half of those with&nbsp;transverse myelitis&nbsp;report pain as the first symptom of the disorder. The pain can be localized to the back, or appear as sharp, shooting pain that radiates down the legs, arms or around the torso.[608][610]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Sensory alteration:</strong>&nbsp;Loss of the ability to experience pain or temperature sensitivity is one of the most common sensory changes. Patients who are experiencing altered sensitivity usually report numbness, tingling, coldness or burning. Up to 80 percent of people with transverse myelitis experience heightened sensitivity to touch. Some even report that wearing clothes or a light touch with a finger causes significant pain.[608][610] Many also experience heightened sensitivity to changes in temperature or to extreme heat or cold.[608]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Bowel and bladder dysfunction:</strong>&nbsp;Some people with transverse myelitis report bowel or bladder dysfunction as their first symptom.

When it occurs without apparent underlying cause, it is referred to as <em>idiopathic</em>.[608] Transverse myelitis is idiopathic in about 60% of cases.[610] Recents studies have discovered circulating antibodies to the proteins aquaporin-4 and anti-myelin oligodendrocyte which may be the definite cause in some individuals with transverse myelitis.&nbsp; Antibodies are proteins produced by cells of the immune system that bind to bacteria, viruses, and foreign chemicals to prevent them from harming the body.&nbsp; In autoimmune disorders, antibodies incorrectly bind to normal body proteins.&nbsp; Aquaporin-4 is a key protein that carries water through the cell membrane of neural cells.&nbsp; The myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein sits on the outer layer of myelin.[608]&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe following illnesses or agents have been associated with transverse myelitis:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Infectious agents.</strong>&nbsp;Transverse myelitis often develops following viral infections. Infectious agents suspected of causing transverse myelitis include varicella zoster (the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles), herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, influenza, echovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis A, measles, and rubella. Bacterial skin infections, middle-ear infections (<em>otitis media</em>), syphilis, Lyme disease, and <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> (bacterial pneumonia) have also been associated with the condition.[608]&nbsp;In some cases, the infectious agent may&nbsp;directly invade the spinal cord and produce symptoms of transverse myelitis. [612] In&nbsp;other post-infectious cases of transverse myelitis, immune system mechanisms, rather than active viral or bacterial infections, appear to play an important role in causing damage to spinal nerves.[608][612] Although researchers have not yet identified the precise mechanisms of spinal cord injury in these cases, stimulation of the immune system in response to infection indicates that an autoimmune reaction may be responsible.[608]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Autoimmune diseases.</strong>&nbsp;Transverse myelitis occasionally develops in people who have other autoimmune diseases.[612] These may include <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000435.htm\" target=\"_blank\">systemic lupus erythematosus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/sjogrens/sjogrens.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Sjogren&rsquo;s syndrome</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/sarc/sar_whatis.html\" target=\"_blank\">sarcoidosis</a>.[608][612]In autoimmune diseases, the immune system, which normally protects the body from foreign organisms, mistakenly attacks the body&rsquo;s own tissue, causing inflammation and, in some cases, damage to myelin within the spinal cord.[608]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Underlying demyelinating disease of the central nervous system.</strong> In some people, transverse myelitis represents the first symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS) or neuromyelitis optica (NMO).[608][612] A form of transverse myelitis called \"partial\" myelitis (as it affects only a portion of the cross-sectional area of the spinal cord) is more characteristic of MS.[608]&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 14.4px;\">This type of transverse myelitis usually affects only one side of the body.[608][612]&nbsp;</span>Neuromyelitis optica typically causes both transverse myelitis and optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve that results in vision loss), but not necessarily at the same time.[608] &nbsp;All patients with transverse myelitis should be evaluated for MS or NMO because patients with these diagnoses may require different treatments, especially therapies to prevent future attacks.[608]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Vaccinations.</strong>&nbsp;Rarely, transverse myelitis may develop following certain vaccinations (hepatitis B, measles-mumps-rubella, and diptheria-tetanus).[612] Although it's unclear how transverse myelitis and vaccinations are related, an immune response is suggested.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Cancers.</strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">&nbsp;Myelitis related to cancer&nbsp;is uncommon.

Physicians often prescribe <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/steroids.html\" target=\"_blank\">corticosteroid therapy</a> during the first few weeks of illness to decrease inflammation. Although no clinical trials have investigated whether corticosteroids alter the course of transverse myelitis, these drugs often are prescribed to reduce immune system activity because of the suspected autoimmune mechanisms involved in the disorder.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs &mdash; such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, others) &mdash; can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain.[614] Bed rest is often recommended during the initial days and weeks after onset of the disorder.[608]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBased on patient response and test results, additional therapeutic options may be added. Plasma exchange therapy is often used for those with moderate to severe&nbsp;transverse myelitis&nbsp;who don&rsquo;t show much improvement after being treated with intravenous steroids.[610][612]&nbsp;This therapy involves removing the straw-colored fluid in which blood cells are suspended (plasma) and replacing the plasma loss with special fluids. It's not certain how this therapy helps people with transverse myelitis, but it may be that plasma exchange removes antibodies that are involved in inflammation.[612]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome patients respond very well to intravenous <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682080.html\" target=\"_blank\">cyclophosphamide</a> (a drug often used for lymphomas or leukemia).

The segment of the spinal cord that has inflammation or damage determines the symptoms a person has. Generally, inflammation at one segment causes symptoms at that level and below that level. Most commonly, the upper spinal cord is affected, causing impaired leg movement, and problems controlling the bowel and bladder. The onset of symptoms may be acute (sudden, developing over hours or days) or subacute (developing over weeks).[608] The cause of transverse myelitis may be unknown (idiopathic) or it may be associated with a wide variety of underlying health problems, including infections, immune system disorders, and other inflammatory disorders.[608][609] Tests that may be used to diagnose transverse myelitis include MRI to look for compression or inflammation of the spinal cord, and a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to look for evidence of inflammation in the fluid surrounding the spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid). Treatment options may include intravenous steroids, pain medicines, <a href=\"https://www.aan.com/Guidelines/home/GetGuidelineContent/472\" target=\"_blank\">plasmapheresis</a> (also called plasma exchange), <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-beyond-the-basics\" target=\"_blank\">intravenous immunoglobulin</a> (IVIG), and <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682080.html\" target=\"_blank\">cyclophosphamide</a>.[608][609] Some people have full or partial recovery from symptoms, while others do not recover any lost function in the affected parts of the body.[14474] Most people recover at least partially, although recovery can take up to 2 or 3 years.

Paraparesis often progresses to <em>paraplegia</em> (paralysis of the legs and lower part of the trunk). Urinary bladder and bowel dysfunction is common.

Patients who are experiencing altered sensitivity usually report numbness, tingling, coldness or burning. Up to 80 percent of people with transverse myelitis experience heightened sensitivity to touch. Some even report that wearing clothes or a light touch with a finger causes significant pain.[608][610] Many also experience heightened sensitivity to changes in temperature or to extreme heat or cold.[608]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Bowel and bladder dysfunction:</strong>&nbsp;Some people with transverse myelitis report bowel or bladder dysfunction as their first symptom.

When it occurs without apparent underlying cause, it is referred to as <em>idiopathic</em>.[608] Transverse myelitis is idiopathic in about 60% of cases.[610] Recents studies have discovered circulating antibodies to the proteins aquaporin-4 and anti-myelin oligodendrocyte which may be the definite cause in some individuals with transverse myelitis.&nbsp; Antibodies are proteins produced by cells of the immune system that bind to bacteria, viruses, and foreign chemicals to prevent them from harming the body.&nbsp; In autoimmune disorders, antibodies incorrectly bind to normal body proteins.&nbsp; Aquaporin-4 is a key protein that carries water through the cell membrane of neural cells.&nbsp; The myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein sits on the outer layer of myelin.[608]&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe following illnesses or agents have been associated with transverse myelitis:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Infectious agents.</strong>&nbsp;Transverse myelitis often develops following viral infections. Infectious agents suspected of causing transverse myelitis include varicella zoster (the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles), herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, influenza, echovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis A, measles, and rubella. Bacterial skin infections, middle-ear infections (<em>otitis media</em>), syphilis, Lyme disease, and <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> (bacterial pneumonia) have also been associated with the condition.[608]&nbsp;In some cases, the infectious agent may&nbsp;directly invade the spinal cord and produce symptoms of transverse myelitis. [612] In&nbsp;other post-infectious cases of transverse myelitis, immune system mechanisms, rather than active viral or bacterial infections, appear to play an important role in causing damage to spinal nerves.[608][612] Although researchers have not yet identified the precise mechanisms of spinal cord injury in these cases, stimulation of the immune system in response to infection indicates that an autoimmune reaction may be responsible.[608]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Autoimmune diseases.</strong>&nbsp;Transverse myelitis occasionally develops in people who have other autoimmune diseases.[612] These may include <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000435.htm\" target=\"_blank\">systemic lupus erythematosus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/sjogrens/sjogrens.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Sjogren&rsquo;s syndrome</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/sarc/sar_whatis.html\" target=\"_blank\">sarcoidosis</a>.[608][612]In autoimmune diseases, the immune system, which normally protects the body from foreign organisms, mistakenly attacks the body&rsquo;s own tissue, causing inflammation and, in some cases, damage to myelin within the spinal cord.[608]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Underlying demyelinating disease of the central nervous system.</strong> In some people, transverse myelitis represents the first symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS) or neuromyelitis optica (NMO).[608][612] A form of transverse myelitis called \"partial\" myelitis (as it affects only a portion of the cross-sectional area of the spinal cord) is more characteristic of MS.[608]&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 14.4px;\">This type of transverse myelitis usually affects only one side of the body.[608][612]&nbsp;</span>Neuromyelitis optica typically causes both transverse myelitis and optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve that results in vision loss), but not necessarily at the same time.[608] &nbsp;All patients with transverse myelitis should be evaluated for MS or NMO because patients with these diagnoses may require different treatments, especially therapies to prevent future attacks.[608]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Vaccinations.</strong>&nbsp;Rarely, transverse myelitis may develop following certain vaccinations (hepatitis B, measles-mumps-rubella, and diptheria-tetanus).[612] Although it's unclear how transverse myelitis and vaccinations are related, an immune response is suggested.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Cancers.</strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">&nbsp;Myelitis related to cancer&nbsp;is uncommon.

Physicians often prescribe <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/steroids.html\" target=\"_blank\">corticosteroid therapy</a> during the first few weeks of illness to decrease inflammation. Although no clinical trials have investigated whether corticosteroids alter the course of transverse myelitis, these drugs often are prescribed to reduce immune system activity because of the suspected autoimmune mechanisms involved in the disorder.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs &mdash; such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, others) &mdash; can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain.[614] Bed rest is often recommended during the initial days and weeks after onset of the disorder.[608]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBased on patient response and test results, additional therapeutic options may be added. Plasma exchange therapy is often used for those with moderate to severe&nbsp;transverse myelitis&nbsp;who don&rsquo;t show much improvement after being treated with intravenous steroids.[610][612]&nbsp;This therapy involves removing the straw-colored fluid in which blood cells are suspended (plasma) and replacing the plasma loss with special fluids. It's not certain how this therapy helps people with transverse myelitis, but it may be that plasma exchange removes antibodies that are involved in inflammation.[612]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome patients respond very well to intravenous <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682080.html\" target=\"_blank\">cyclophosphamide</a> (a drug often used for lymphomas or leukemia).

For example, they regain the ability to walk and experience few or no long-term urinary or bowel problems, and recover from paresthesias. Another one-third have partial recovery and may continue to have a spastic gait, sensory dysfunction, and urinary urgency or incontinence. The remaining one-third continue to have severe mobility problems and require assistance for the functions of daily living.
