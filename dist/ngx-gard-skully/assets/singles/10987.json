These nerves roots connect the central nervous system and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0024546/\" target=\"_blank\">peripheral nervous system</a>. CES can lead to pain, numbness, and weakness in the lower back, pelvic area and legs; \"<a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Foot-Drop-Information-Page\" target=\"_blank\">foot drop</a>\";&nbsp;problems with bowel or bladder control; sexual dysfunction; and even paralysis. CES is considered a medical emergency and requires hospitalization.[14430][8915][8916][14431] Therefore, people with unexplained onset of symptoms should seek medical attention as soon as possible and consult with a neurologist or neurosurgeon.[14430][8915][14431]&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCES is most commonly caused by a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000442.htm\" target=\"_blank\">herniated disk</a> in the lumbar spine. Other causes of CES may include a birth abnormality (such as spina bifida), a spinal infection or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?CdrID=46634\" target=\"_blank\">tumor</a>, trauma or injury to the lower back,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000441.htm\" target=\"_blank\">spinal stenosis</a>, a spinal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/arteriovenousmalformations.html\" target=\"_blank\">arteriovenous malformation</a>, and complications after spinal surgery.[14430][8915][8916][14431]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCES can be difficult to diagnose since symptoms vary  and they may mimic other conditions. Tests that may be used to diagnose CES include MRI, CT scan, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/orthopaedic/myelogram_92,p07670\" target=\"_blank\">myelogram</a>&nbsp;(a special type of X-ray of the spinal canal).[14430][8915][14431]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTreatment usually targets the underlying cause of CES (removing the cause of nerve pressure) and most often involves urgent surgery to prevent permanent neurologic impairment.[14431] How well a person recovers from CES often depends on the underlying cause and how promptly they are treated. Symptoms are more likely to improve or go away if the cause is identified quickly and treatment begins right away.[14430] Some people have significant improvement of symptoms and quality of life after treatment. However, others may have permanent neurologic impairment, chronic pain, and/or mental health problems due to the impact of symptoms on social life and relationships.[14431]","dateModified":"2018-03-06T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
