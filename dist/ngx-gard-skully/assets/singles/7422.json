Affected people may also have excess white blood cells and platelets. Conditions where the body makes too many of these cells are known as myeloproliferative neoplasms.[7643] These extra cells cause the blood to be thicker than normal, increasing the risk for <a href=\"http://www.hematology.org/Patients/Clots/\" target=\"_blank\">blood clots</a> that can block blood flow in arteries and veins. If a blood clot occurs in the veins deep in the arms and the legs, it is known as <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/deepveinthrombosis.html\" target=\"_blank\">deep vein thrombosis</a> (DVT). A DVT can sometimes travel through the blood stream to the lungs, which can cause a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/pulmonaryembolism.html\" target=\"_blank\">pulmonary embolism</a> and is very dangerous. A blood clot could also travel to the heart or brain, which leads to an increased risk for heart attack or <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/stroke.html\" target=\"_blank\">stroke</a>. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost cases of PV are not inherited and are acquired during a person&rsquo;s lifetime. PV is more common as a person ages, and it typically presents for the first time around 60-years-old. PV occurs more frequently in men than it does in women.

This means that the mutations occur in the cells that produce red blood cells (hematopoietic stem cell), but generally not in the egg and sperm cells which pass on genetic information to offspring.[7277] <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn rare cases, the mutation to a gene that causes PV does occur in the egg or sperm cells, which increases the risk that a person with PV will pass the mutation on to their children. In these cases, the condition appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. This means that only one altered copy of a gene is enough to give a person an increased risk for PV. However, not every person who has a mutation in <em>JAK2</em> or <em>TET2</em> will necessarily develop PV.

However, because people with PV have mutations that cause red blood cells to be created constantly, lower levels of erythropoietin do not control the number of red blood cells. Because people with PV have consistently high number of red blood cells, the body tries to control this problem by secreting low levels of erythropoietin.[13054]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf low levels of erythropoietin are found in the blood as well as mutations in either <em>JAK2</em> or <em>TET2</em>, an individual can be diagnosed with polycythemia vera.
