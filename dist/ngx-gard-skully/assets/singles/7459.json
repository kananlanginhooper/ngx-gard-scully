This medication, which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of PBC, has been shown to slow disease progression and reduce the need for a liver transplant.[15236][15237] Liver function should be monitored periodically to help detect people who do not adequately respond to UDCA.[15237] Because UDCA therapy does not improve fatigue, itching (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/itching.html\" target=\"_blank\">pruritus</a>), bone problems, and many other signs and symptoms of PBC, these should be addressed separately.[15237] <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span><a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a616033.html\">Obeticholic acid</a></span> (OCA), a second-line treatment for PBC, is also approved by the FDA.
