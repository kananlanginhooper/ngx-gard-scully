As a result, affected people may experience frequent nosebleeds and abnormally heavy or prolonged bleeding following minor injury or surgery. Women with the condition often have heavy or prolonged menstrual periods. Glycoprotein VI deficiency can be caused by changes (mutations) in the <em><a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/GP6\" target=\"_blank\">GP6</a></em> gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Some cases appear to be acquired (not caused by inherited gene mutations) and are often associated with autoimmune conditions. Treatment varies based on the severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms.[13688][13689][13690]","dateModified":"2017-08-09T15:39:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
