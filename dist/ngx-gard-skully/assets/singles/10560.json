Amyloidosis AA is also&nbsp;referred to as&nbsp;Secondary amyloidosis&nbsp;or&nbsp;Inflammatory amyloidosis.&nbsp;This disease is caused by a&nbsp;long-lasting infection or inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever, or osteomyelitis. Infection or <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072482/\" target=\"_blank\">inflammation</a>&nbsp;in the body causes an increased amount of a specific protein called serum amyloid A (SAA) protein. In this disease, part of the SAA protein forms deposits called \"amyloid fibrils\". These desposits occur in the space around the cells&nbsp;of certain tissues of the body. Amyloidosis AA usually begins as a disease in the kidneys, but other organs can be affected such as the liver and spleen. Medical or surgical treatment of the underlying infection or inflammatory disease can slow down or stop the progression of this condition.[7084][7085]</div>","dateModified":"2014-01-03T23:05:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":7189,"questionText":"What are&nbsp;the most current treatments for this disease?","answerText":"In<strong> </strong>amyloidosis AA, the treatment depends on the underlying disease.
