There are three different types of adrenal cancer which vary by location and the age at which they are often diagnosed:<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><em><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/558/adrenocortical-carcinoma\" target=\"_blank\">Adrenocortical carcinoma</a></em> - The most common type of adrenal cancer which develops in the adrenal cortex (the outer part of the adrenal gland)</li>\r\n    <li><em><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7185/neuroblastoma\" target=\"_blank\">Neuroblastoma</a></em> - A childhood cancer that begins in the adrenal medulla (the inner part of the adrenal gland)</li>\r\n    <li><em><a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7385/pheochromocytoma\" target=\"_blank\">Pheochromocytoma</a></em> - A <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/neuroendocrine-tumors/home/ovc-20208330\" target=\"_blank\">neuroendocrine tumor</a> that begins in the adrenal medulla</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe signs and symptoms associated with the condition largely depend on if the cancer is 'functioning' (producing hormones) or 'nonfunctioning' (not producing hormones) and which hormones are present in excess. In most cases, the underlying cause of the condition is unknown. However, certain genetic conditions such as <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/3830/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2\" target=\"_blank\">multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6902/li-fraumeni-syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Li-Fraumeni syndrome</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7855/von-hippel-lindau-disease\" target=\"_blank\">Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome</a>, <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7866/neurofibromatosis-type-1\" target=\"_blank\">neurofibromatosis type I</a>, and <a href=\"https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/1119/carney-complex\" target=\"_blank\">Carney complex</a> are associated with an increased risk of developing adrenal tumors and cancer.
