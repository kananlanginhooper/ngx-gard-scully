Other common signs and symptoms include abnormal external ears, fusion (syndactyly) of the hands and feet, skin findings (such as dry and coarse skin or redundant folds of skin), absent or sparse hair, genital malformations, and developmental delay. Other reported findings include underdeveloped cheeks (malar hypoplasia), absent or very small (hypoplastic) nipples, umbilical abnormalities and growth retardation.[13146][13147] It belongs to a group of diseases called <a href=\"https://www.nfed.org/\">ectodermal dysplasias</a>&nbsp;(genetic disorders that involve defects in the skin, hair, nails, sweat glands, and/or teeth).
