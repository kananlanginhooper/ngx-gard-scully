Steroids (such as prednisone), taken by mouth or via an injection in the skin, can shrink the masses but the mass often reappears after treatment is stopped. Steroids can also be used to treat the kidney disease.[15016] Other, less common, treatments include medications that decrease swelling and increase blood flow (such as oral pentoxifylline), medications that suppress the immune system (such as cyclosporine), radiotherapy, and a combination of several medications and steroids.[15010][15015][15017]</p>","dateModified":"2018-10-18T00:00:00","resourceClassificationName":"Treatment","references":[{"referenceId":15010,"authors":"Synder A.","articleTitle":"Kimura Disease","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"Updated: Apr. 27, 2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1098777-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15013,"authors":"Sun QF, Xu DZ, Pan SH, Ding JG, Xue ZQ, Miao CS et al","articleTitle":"Kimura disease: review of the literature","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Intern Med J","date":"2008","volume":"38","pages":"668-672","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18808562","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15015,"authors":"Bobinskas A, Chandu A, Nastri A","articleTitle":"Kimura's disease: an uncommon cause of head and neck masses with potentially serious sequelae","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Journal of Surg Case Reports","date":"2015","volume":"10","pages":"1-3","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4616046","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15016,"authors":"Ye P, Ma DQ, Yu GY, Gao Y, Peng X","articleTitle":"Comparison of the efficacy of different treatment modalities for Kimura's disease","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Int J Oral Maxillofac Surg","date":"2017","volume":"46(3)","pages":"350-354","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27614905","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15017,"authors":"Carretero R, Brugera M, Rebollo-Aparicio N, Vazquez-Gomez O","articleTitle":"Eosinophila and multiple lymphadenopathy: Kimura disease, a rare, but benign condition","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"BMJ Case Rep","date":"Publ online: August 17, 2016","volume":"","pages":"1-3","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5015188/pdf/bcr-2015-214211.pdf","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":12997,"questionText":"What is the cause of Kimura disease?&nbsp;","answerText":"The cause of Kimura disease is unknown, but it appears to be due to an abnormal immune response.[15010][15013][15016]","dateModified":"2018-10-19T16:37:00","resourceClassificationName":"Cause","references":[{"referenceId":15010,"authors":"Synder A.","articleTitle":"Kimura Disease","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Medscape Reference","date":"Updated: Apr. 27, 2017","volume":"","pages":"","url":"https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1098777-overview","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15013,"authors":"Sun QF, Xu DZ, Pan SH, Ding JG, Xue ZQ, Miao CS et al","articleTitle":"Kimura disease: review of the literature","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Intern Med J","date":"2008","volume":"38","pages":"668-672","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18808562","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""},{"referenceId":15016,"authors":"Ye P, Ma DQ, Yu GY, Gao Y, Peng X","articleTitle":"Comparison of the efficacy of different treatment modalities for Kimura's disease","bookWebsiteJournalTitle":"Int J Oral Maxillofac Surg","date":"2017","volume":"46(3)","pages":"350-354","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27614905","authors2":"","placeOfPublication":"","publisher":""}]},{"questionId":12999,"questionText":"How many people have Kimura disease?","answerText":"Kimura disease occurs most often in adults of Asian descent, but can occur in any ethnic group.
