It is usually diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, although in some cases, the condition can be detected before birth. Many affected individuals have yellowing of the skin and eyes (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000210.htm\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">jaundice</a>) and an enlarged liver and spleen (<a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/17215.htm\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">hepatosplenomegaly</a>). This condition also causes the body to absorb too much iron, which builds up and can damage tissues and organs. In particular, iron overload can lead to an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), congestive heart failure, diabetes, and chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). Rarely, people with CDA type I are born with skeletal abnormalities, most often involving the fingers and/or toes.
