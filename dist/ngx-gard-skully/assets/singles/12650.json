Naegleria fowleri produces an acute, and usually lethal, central nervous system (CNS) disease called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Acanthamoeba spp. and Balamuthia mandrillaris are opportunistic free-living amebae capable of causing granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE) in individuals with compromised immune systems. Sappinia pedata has been implicated in a case of amebic encephalitis. Naegleria fowleri and Acanthamoeba spp., are commonly found in lakes, swimming pools, tap water, and heating and air conditioning units.[9156]","dateModified":"2015-06-24T10:07:00"},"basicQuestions":[],"references":[],"relatedDiseases":[{"relatedDiseaseId":9285,"relatedDiseaseName":"Acanthamoeba keratitis","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":12651,"relatedDiseaseName":"Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true},{"relatedDiseaseId":9554,"relatedDiseaseName":"Primary amebic meningoencephalitis","relation":"Child","isRare":true,"hasGardPage":true}],"gardCases":[],"news":[{"newsId":671,"dateCreated":"2020-05-20T13:39:00","publishDate":"2020-05-22T00:00:00","title":"NIH-Supported Research Survey to Examine Impact of COVID-19 on Rare Diseases Community","description":"The NIH-funded Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) has launched an <a href=\"https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/COVIDsurvey \" target=\"_blank\">online research survey</a> to find out how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting individuals with rare diseases, their families and their caregivers.
