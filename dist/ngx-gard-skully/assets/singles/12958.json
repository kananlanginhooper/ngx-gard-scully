It has also been associated with a kidney disease known as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.kidney-cares.org/nephritis-diagnosis/633.html\" target=\"_blank\">mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis</a>. C1q is a <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/howgeneswork/protein\" target=\"_blank\">protein</a>  and together with other proteins, C1r and C1s, it forms the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27100/\" target=\"_blank\">C1 complex</a>. This complex is important for the activation of  the <a href=\"https://courses.washington.edu/conj/inflammation/complement.htm\" target=\"_blank\">complement system</a> (a group of proteins that work with the <a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/immune.html\" target=\"_blank\">immune system</a>). It also disposes cells that are dead. C1q deficiency presents in 2 different forms, absent C1q protein or abnormal C1q protein.[10980] Symptoms include infections (ear infections (otitis media), <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000680.htm\" target=\"_blank\">meningitis</a>, urinary tract infections, oral infections); skin lesions (small blisters (vesicles), dark patches, and atrophic areas) that get worse upon light exposure;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nei.nih.gov/health/cataract/cataract_facts\" target=\"_blank\">cataracts</a>;&nbsp;loss of eyelashes, eyebrows, and scalp hair; blood in urine; and <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000484.htm\" target=\"_blank\">glomerulonephritis</a>. About 93% of cases are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.[10980][10981] It can be caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a>  in the <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/C1QA\" target=\"_blank\">C1QA</a>, <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/C1QB\" target=\"_blank\">C1QB</a> or <a href=\"https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/C1QC\" target=\"_blank\">C1QC</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">genes</a>  and is inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002052.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal recessive</a>  pattern.[10982] Treatment depends on the symptoms.
