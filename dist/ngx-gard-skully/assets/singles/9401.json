Symptoms include dull and persistent throat pain that may radiate to the ear and worsen with rotation of the head. Other symptoms may include difficulty swallowing, feeling that there is something stuck in the throat,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/tinnitus.html\" target=\"_blank\">tinnitus</a>,&nbsp;and neck or facial pain. A second form of Eagle syndrome  unrelated to tonsillectomy causes compression of the vessel that carries blood to the brain, neck, and face (carotid artery).
