The thickening most often occurs in the muscle wall that separates the left and right ventricles from each other (interventricular septum). This may restrict the flow of oxygen-rich blood from the heart, or it may lead to less efficient pumping of blood. Signs and symptoms can vary. While some people have no symptoms, others may have chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness, dizziness, and/or fainting. Even in the absence of symptoms, familial HCM can have serious consequences such as life-threatening <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001101.htm\" target=\"_blank\">arrhythmias</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000158.htm\" target=\"_blank\">heart failure</a>, and an increased risk of sudden death. Familial HCM may be caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\">mutations</a> in any of several <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\">genes</a> and is typically inherited in an <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002049.htm\" target=\"_blank\">autosomal dominant</a> manner.[10101] Treatment may depend on severity of symptoms and may include medications, surgical procedures, and/or an <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007370.htm\" target=\"_blank\">implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)</a>.[10102]","dateModified":"2016-12-28T00:00:00"},"basicQuestions":[{"questionId":9746,"questionText":"What causes familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?","answerText":"Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">mutations</a> in any of several <a href=\"http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70\" target=\"_blank\" tabindex=\"-1\">genes</a>.

The proteins form structures in muscle cells called sarcomeres, which are needed for muscle contractions.

The contractions of heart muscle are needed to pump blood to the rest of the body.[10101]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile it is unclear exactly how mutations in these genes cause familial HCM, they are thought to lead to abnormal structure or function of sarcomeres, or reduce the amount of proteins made.
