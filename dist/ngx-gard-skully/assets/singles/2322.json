Lipomas have been reported in patients with BHDS, albeit rarely.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDue to your husband's RCC and lung cyst, a consultation with a genetics professional may be helpful for evaluation of BHDS. During this visit, a genetic counselor or medical geneticist will likely obtain a detailed medical and cancer history, and a comprehensive family history (in particular looking for other relatives with renal cancer or the other features of BHDS). If it seems that your husband's personal medical history and family history are suggestive of BHDS, then genetic testing for diagnosis of BHDS can be discussed.
