Typically, the \"choice\" of which X chromosome to inactivate is random, which theoretically would lead to each X chromosome being inactivated around 50% of the time. However, in come cases, the activation is skewed, leading to one X chromosome being inactivated significantly more than the other. If a female has a <em>G6PD</em> mutation on the X chromosome that is significantly more active, she can have mild to severe symptoms of G6PD deficiency.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is&nbsp;one enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, a pathway&nbsp;which processes glucose.&nbsp;The main reasons for this pathway is actually not to metabolize dietary sugars but to make ribose-5-phosphate which is important for making <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/basics/dna\" target=\"_blank\">DNA</a> and <a href=\"http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=rna\" target=\"_blank\">RNA</a>, and to make NADPH which is important for protecting cells from potentially harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species.
